# Session: 2026-01-05 - Initial Memory Infrastructure

**Session ID**: init-2026-01-05
**Duration**: ~30 min
**Outcome**: Memory infrastructure bootstrapped

---

## What Was Accomplished

1. Created `claude.md` - Quick-start reference with all context
2. Created `STATE.md` - Current build state tracker
3. Created `DECISIONS.md` - Build-time decision log
4. Created `sessions/` directory for handoff notes

## Key Decisions Made

- Memory infrastructure uses simple markdown files (not database yet)
- Three-tier system: STATE.md (current), DECISIONS.md (historical), sessions/ (per-session)

## What Was NOT Done

- Directory scaffolding (deferred - awaiting user preference)
- Phase -1 bug selection (need KareMatch repo location)
- Any implementation code

## Blockers / Open Questions

1. **KareMatch repo location** - Needed to select bugs for Phase -1
2. **CredentialMate repo location** - Needed for adapter config
3. **Scaffold timing** - Now vs Phase 0?

## Files Modified

| File | Action |
|------|--------|
| `claude.md` | Created |
| `STATE.md` | Created |
| `DECISIONS.md` | Created |
| `sessions/2026-01-05-init.md` | Created (this file) |

## Context for Next Session

Read in this order:
1. `claude.md` - Orientation (what is this project)
2. `STATE.md` - Current state (what's done, what's next)
3. `DECISIONS.md` - Decisions made (what not to re-litigate)
4. `sessions/latest.md` - Most recent session notes

## Handoff Notes

The user asked a key question: "When will external artifacts be created so agents can act autonomously?"

Answer: **Now.** We created them in this session. The memory infrastructure is:

```
STATE.md          → What's the current state? (read first on resume)
DECISIONS.md      → What decisions were made? (prevents re-litigation)
sessions/*.md     → What happened per session? (detailed context)
```

This matches the v4 design principle: "Sessions are stateless, memory is externalized."

Next session should:
1. Get repo locations from user (KareMatch, CredentialMate)
2. Decide: scaffold directories now or wait for Phase 0?
3. If Phase -1: begin bug selection from KareMatch
