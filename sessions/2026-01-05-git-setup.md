# Session: 2026-01-05 - Git Setup & .claude Configuration

**Session ID**: git-setup-2026-01-05
**Duration**: ~15 min
**Outcome**: Repository initialized and pushed to GitHub with .claude configuration

---

## What Was Accomplished

1. **Created `.claude` file**:
   - Enforces mandatory session startup protocol (read STATE.md, DECISIONS.md, sessions/latest.md)
   - Documents core principles (stateless sessions, externalized memory)
   - Includes session handoff protocol template
   - References key planning documents
   - Lists target repositories
   - Shows governance hierarchy

2. **Created `.gitignore`**:
   - Python-specific ignores (__pycache__, venv, etc.)
   - IDE files (.vscode, .idea)
   - Database files (*.db, *.sqlite)
   - Environment files (.env)
   - Knowledge drafts (not committed until approved)
   - Keeps directory structure with .gitkeep files

3. **Created `.gitkeep` files** for empty directories:
   - `knowledge/approved/`, `knowledge/drafts/`
   - `ralph/guardrails/`, `ralph/steps/`, `ralph/audit/`, `ralph/context/`
   - `tests/agents/`, `tests/integration/`
   - `docs/`

4. **Initialized Git repository**:
   - `git init`
   - Added remote: https://github.com/perlahm0404/AI-Orchestrator.git
   - Created initial commit with all 60 files
   - Pushed to main branch

## What Was NOT Done

- Git user configuration (git suggested setting user.name and user.email globally)
- README.md creation (not requested)
- Phase -1 bug selection (next step)

## Blockers / Open Questions

None.

## Handoff Notes

**Git repository is now live at**: https://github.com/perlahm0404/AI-Orchestrator

**The `.claude` file enforces**:
- Session startup checklist (MUST read STATE.md, DECISIONS.md, sessions/latest.md)
- Session handoff protocol (create session notes at end)
- Core principles (stateless, externalized memory, TDD)
- References to planning docs

**Next session should**:
1. Read the session startup files per `.claude` protocol
2. Either:
   - Start Phase -1: Select bugs from KareMatch
   - Create README.md if desired
   - Begin implementation work on Phase 0 components

**Key insight**: The `.claude` file acts as a forcing function to ensure every future Claude session follows the memory protocol, preventing context loss between sessions.
