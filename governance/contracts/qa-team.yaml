# QA Team Autonomy Contract
#
# Defines what the QA Team agents (BugFix, CodeQuality, TestFixer) can do.
# QA Team maintains code quality on EXISTING stable code.
# Higher autonomy than Dev Team - safe operations on known code.
#
# Enforced at runtime by governance hooks.

agent: qa-team
version: "1.0"
team: quality-assurance

# L2 = Higher autonomy (safe operations on stable code)
# L1 = Stricter autonomy (Dev Team)
autonomy_level: L2

description: |
  QA Team maintains and improves code quality on production code.
  Works on main branch and fix/* branches only.
  Must not change behavior - test count stays the same.
  Ralph verification on every commit.
