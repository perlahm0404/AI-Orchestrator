**Generated**: 2026-01-18T19:00:00

## Task Context
- ID: TASK-001
- Title: Implement HIPAA audit logging
- Description: Add comprehensive PHI access logging
- Attempts: 3
- Iterations: 45

## What Happened
Task escalated after 45 iterations. Agent unable to complete due to complexity.

## CITO Analysis
**Complexity Score**: 75/100
**Risk Level**: MEDIUM
**Recommended Team**: dev

### Why CITO Can't Decide
High complexity requires human judgment.

## Options for Human Decision

### Option 1: Approve and Continue
- What: Continue with current approach
- Risk: MEDIUM
- CITO Recommendation: Proceed if task is low-risk and non-critical

### Option 2: Modify Approach
- What: Adjust iteration budget or constraints
- Risk: MEDIUM
- CITO Recommendation: Extend budget if making progress

### Option 3: Reject and Block
- What: Mark task as blocked for manual intervention
- Impact: Task will be deferred
- CITO Recommendation: Block if requirements unclear or too risky

## CITO Recommendation
MODIFY - Extend budget, monitor progress

**Confidence**: 60%

## How to Respond
```bash
# To approve and continue
python orchestration/cito_resolver.py resolve TASK-001 --action approve

# To modify (e.g., extend iterations)
python orchestration/cito_resolver.py resolve TASK-001 --action modify --iterations 100

# To reject and block
python orchestration/cito_resolver.py resolve TASK-001 --action block
```
