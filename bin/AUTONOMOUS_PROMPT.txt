Implement the complete Dev Team architecture for AI Orchestrator.

CONTEXT:
- AI Orchestrator has a working QA Team (BugFix, CodeQuality) with 89% autonomy
- Dev Team planned in v5 but never implemented
- Need: FeatureBuilder agent, TestWriter agent, feature workflow integration

TASKS (in order):

1. CREATE FeatureBuilder Agent (agents/featurebuilder.py)
   - Inherit from BaseAgent
   - Use ClaudeCliWrapper (like BugFix)
   - Load "dev-team" contract
   - Config: max_iterations=50, completion_signal="FEATURE_COMPLETE"
   - Only works on feature/* branches (validate in execute())
   - No per-commit Ralph (contract: verify_on_commit=false)
   - Higher limits: 500 lines, 20 files
   - Template: Use agents/bugfix.py as reference

2. CREATE TestWriter Agent (agents/testwriter.py)
   - Specializes in Vitest/Playwright tests
   - Use ClaudeCliWrapper
   - Config: max_iterations=15, completion_signal="TESTS_COMPLETE"
   - Must achieve 80%+ coverage
   - Can use .todo for WIP tests
   - Cannot delete existing tests

3. UPDATE Work Queue Format (tasks/work_queue.py)
   - Add fields: type ("bugfix"|"feature"|"test")
   - Add fields: branch (e.g. "feature/matching-algorithm")
   - Add fields: agent ("BugFix"|"FeatureBuilder"|"TestWriter")
   - Add fields: requires_approval (list of approval items)

4. INTEGRATE into Factory (agents/factory.py)
   - Add FEAT/FEATURE → FeatureBuilder
   - Add TEST/TESTS → TestWriter
   - Update infer_agent_type() with new prefixes

5. UPDATE Autonomous Loop (autonomous_loop.py)
   - Support queue_type parameter (--queue features)
   - Handle task.type == "feature"
   - Create/checkout feature branch if needed
   - Check requires_approval and pause for human input

6. CREATE First Feature Task (tasks/work_queue_karematch_features.json)
   - Manual JSON file with 1 task
   - Task: Implement deterministic matching logic
   - File: services/matching/src/routes.ts
   - Branch: feature/matching-algorithm

7. TEST: Run autonomous loop with feature task
   - python autonomous_loop.py --project karematch --queue features

8. UPDATE Documentation
   - STATE.md → v5.4
   - Create sessions/2026-01-06-dev-team-implementation.md
   - Update DECISIONS.md

REFERENCE FILES:
- tasks/dev_team_implementation.md (detailed specs)
- agents/bugfix.py (template for agents)
- governance/contracts/dev-team.yaml (contract to enforce)
- docs/planning/v5-Planning.md (full architecture)

COMPLETION SIGNALS:
- FeatureBuilder: <promise>FEATURE_COMPLETE</promise>
- TestWriter: <promise>TESTS_COMPLETE</promise>

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
✓ agents/featurebuilder.py exists
✓ agents/testwriter.py exists
✓ Work queue supports feature tasks
✓ Factory instantiates dev team agents
✓ Autonomous loop handles features
✓ First feature task runs successfully
✓ All existing tests pass (226/226)

Start with Task 1 and work sequentially. Use Wiggum iteration control (up to 50 retries per task).
