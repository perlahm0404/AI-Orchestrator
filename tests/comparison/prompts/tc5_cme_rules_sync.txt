You are debugging a data synchronization issue in a healthcare compliance system.

## Problem Statement
A rules engine that tracks Continuing Medical Education (CME) requirements across 61 state medical boards has 61 failing tests. The system pulls data from three sources:
1. FSMB (Federation of State Medical Boards) PDF documents (regulatory source)
2. YAML files (single source of truth)
3. JSON rule packs (runtime engine)

The synchronization between these sources has broken, causing test failures.

## Available Context
- All 61 state boards have different CME requirements
- Rules include numeric requirements (e.g., "20 hours Category 1")
- Rules include semantic nuances (e.g., "NOT including" vs "excluding")
- Previously, 865 tests were passing
- Recent updates to YAML files caused sync issues
- JSON rule packs are auto-generated from YAML

## Sample Failing Test
```
State: California
Rule: "CME Category 1: 20 hours NOT including ethics"
Expected: ethics should be in a separate requirement
Actual: ethics is being included in the 20-hour requirement
Result: FAIL
```

## Your Task
1. Identify what type of synchronization issue this is
2. Determine the root cause of the semantic parsing failure
3. Design a solution to restore sync across all 3 sources
4. Provide a verification strategy to ensure all 865 tests pass

## Expected Output
- Problem classification (data schema mismatch, semantic parsing, normalization, etc.)
- Root cause identification with examples
- Multi-step solution design
- Normalization patterns needed
- Verification approach to validate all 61 boards

## Evaluation Criteria
You will be evaluated on:
1. **Quality**: Did you identify the semantic parsing issue correctly?
2. **Reasoning Depth**: Did you consider multiple types of sync issues?
3. **Actionability**: Can an engineer implement the fix and restore 865 passing tests?

## Additional Hints
- Pay close attention to the phrase "NOT including"
- Consider how regulatory language differs from code logic
- Think about how to represent negation in rule engines
- The solution should work across all 61 state boards
