You are optimizing context token usage for an AI agent system.

## Problem Statement
An autonomous AI agent system loads extensive context at startup (STATE.md, governance contracts, documentation). The current implementation uses 15,000+ tokens per session, causing:
1. High API costs
2. Slower response times
3. Reduced effective context window for actual work

You need to reduce token usage without losing critical information that agents need.

## Available Context
- STATE.md contains 8,500 tokens of implementation status
- 40% of STATE.md is "DONE" items (historical, rarely consulted)
- 30% is "BLOCKED" items (informational, not actionable)
- 30% is "IN PROGRESS" or "TODO" (critical for agents)
- Agents consult STATE.md 2-3 times per session
- False negatives (missing critical info) are more expensive than false positives

## Current STATE.md Structure
```markdown
# Phase 1: Foundation ✅ DONE
- Knowledge Object system (100% complete)
- Wiggum iteration control (100% complete)
- Ralph verification (100% complete)

# Phase 2: QA Team 🚧 IN PROGRESS
- BugFix agent (80% complete)
- TestFixer agent (60% complete)

# Phase 3: Dev Team ⏸️ BLOCKED
- FeatureBuilder agent (blocked on turborepo support)
- TestWriter agent (blocked on test framework decisions)

# Phase 4: Optimization ⏸️ TODO
- Token budget system (not started)
- Conditional loading (not started)
```

## Your Task
1. Analyze which STATE.md content can be safely pruned
2. Design a conditional loading strategy for edge cases
3. Calculate token savings vs. risk of missing critical info
4. Provide implementation approach

## Expected Output
- Content classification (critical/useful/optional/archival)
- Pruning strategy with risk analysis
- Conditional loading mechanism design
- Token savings calculation
- Fallback strategy for edge cases

## Evaluation Criteria
You will be evaluated on:
1. **Quality**: Did you maximize savings while preserving critical info?
2. **Reasoning Depth**: Did you consider trade-offs and edge cases?
3. **Actionability**: Can an engineer implement this today?

## Constraints
- Agents should never ask "what's the status of X?" if it's in STATE.md
- Phase boundaries are important (what's done vs. what's next)
- Blocked items need context on WHY they're blocked
- Historical decisions inform current work

Provide your optimization strategy now.
