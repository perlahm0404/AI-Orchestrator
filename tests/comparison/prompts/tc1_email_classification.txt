You are analyzing a classification system failure for an email processing system.

## Problem Statement
An email classification system processes 22,539 emails across 4 categories:
- Personal (family, friends)
- Professional (work-related)
- Receipts (purchase confirmations, invoices)
- Newsletters (bulk marketing, subscriptions)

The system has a 3.3% error rate (744 misclassifications), which is unacceptable for production use.

## Available Context
- System uses rule-based classification with keyword matching
- Errors are concentrated in specific edge cases
- Personal vs. Professional boundary is the most problematic (45% of errors)
- Receipt detection fails on non-standard formats (30% of errors)
- Newsletter detection has false positives (25% of errors)

## Sample Errors
```
Email 1:
Subject: "Dinner with the team Thursday"
Current: Professional
Expected: Personal (team = friends, not work colleagues)
Error Type: Context ambiguity

Email 2:
Subject: "Your Amazon order #123-456 has shipped"
Current: Newsletter
Expected: Receipt
Error Type: Keyword mismatch (no "invoice" or "receipt" keyword)

Email 3:
Subject: "Weekly project update"
Current: Newsletter
Expected: Professional
Error Type: Bulk email pattern false positive
```

## Your Task
1. Identify the root causes of classification errors
2. Design a solution that reduces error rate to <1%
3. Prioritize improvements by impact
4. Provide implementation approach

## Expected Output
- Error pattern analysis (what types of errors are most common?)
- Root cause identification (why does the system fail on these cases?)
- Solution design (rule improvements, hierarchy, weak signal handling)
- Priority ranking (which fixes have highest impact?)
- Implementation approach

## Evaluation Criteria
You will be evaluated on:
1. **Quality**: Did you identify the key failure patterns?
2. **Reasoning Depth**: Did you consider multiple approaches?
3. **Actionability**: Can an engineer implement this immediately?

## Constraints
- Must maintain >99% accuracy on current correct classifications
- Cannot use ML models (rule-based system only)
- Must handle 100+ new emails per day
- Processing time must be <100ms per email
