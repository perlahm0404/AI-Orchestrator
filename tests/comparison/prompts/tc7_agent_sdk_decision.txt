You are evaluating whether to adopt Anthropic's new Agent SDK for an existing autonomous AI agent system.

## Problem Statement
Your organization has built a custom autonomous agent orchestration system (AI Orchestrator) with 6 months of development. Anthropic just released an official Agent SDK with similar capabilities. You need to decide: adopt, reject, or partially integrate?

## Current System (AI Orchestrator)
**Features**:
- Multi-agent orchestration (QA team, Dev team, Operator team)
- Governance contracts (YAML-based autonomy policies)
- Iteration control (Wiggum system: retry budgets, completion signals)
- Verification system (Ralph: PASS/FAIL verdicts on code changes)
- Knowledge Objects (institutional memory across sessions)
- Automated bug discovery (ESLint, TypeScript, test scanning)
- Cross-repo session continuity
- Performance tracking

**Metrics**:
- 91% autonomy achieved
- 30-50 tasks per session
- 523+ tests passing
- Supports 2 production applications (KareMatch, CredentialMate)

**Investment**: ~800 engineering hours

## Anthropic Agent SDK
**Features** (from documentation):
- Task orchestration primitives
- Tool execution framework
- Context management (automatic summarization, long conversations)
- Streaming support
- Token budget management
- Error handling and retries
- Multi-turn conversations

**Benefits**:
- Official support from Anthropic
- Optimized for Claude models
- Regular updates
- Community ecosystem

**Gaps** (vs. current system):
- No governance contract system
- No Ralph-like verification
- No Knowledge Objects
- No multi-agent teams
- No cross-repo session management
- No domain-specific agents (BugFix, CodeQuality, etc.)

## Your Task
Perform a strategic technology evaluation:

1. **Feature Parity Analysis**: Compare SDK vs. current system across 10+ dimensions
2. **Adoption Strategy**: Full adoption, rejection, or partial integration?
3. **Migration Risk Assessment**: What could go wrong?
4. **ROI Analysis**: Time savings vs. migration cost
5. **Recommendation**: Concrete decision with rationale

## Expected Output
- Feature comparison matrix (SDK vs. AI Orchestrator)
- Adoption options analysis (full/partial/none)
- Risk assessment (technical, operational, strategic)
- Migration effort estimation
- Final recommendation with decision criteria

## Evaluation Criteria
You will be evaluated on:
1. **Quality**: Did you consider all strategic dimensions?
2. **Reasoning Depth**: Did you explore trade-offs systematically?
3. **Actionability**: Can leadership make a decision from your analysis?

## Constraints
- Must maintain 91% autonomy level
- Cannot lose domain-specific features (Ralph, governance, KOs)
- Must support multi-repo workflows
- Migration cannot exceed 2 weeks
- No production disruption allowed

## Strategic Context
- Organization values institutional memory (Knowledge Objects)
- Governance is critical (HIPAA compliance for CredentialMate)
- Autonomy is the primary metric (not just task completion)
- Multi-agent teams are core to the architecture
