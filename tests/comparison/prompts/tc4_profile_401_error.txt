You are debugging a critical issue in a production application (KareMatch).

## Problem Statement
Users are seeing "401 Not authenticated" errors when saving therapist profiles, despite being logged in and authenticated. The error appears intermittently and is blocking critical user workflows.

## Available Context
- Authentication middleware is working (users can access protected routes)
- Session management is functioning (users stay logged in)
- CORS configuration appears correct
- Error logs show "401 Not authenticated" but no auth middleware failures
- The error occurs specifically on profile save operations
- Users can navigate the app normally, only profile saves fail

## Your Task
1. Analyze the symptom and identify likely root causes
2. Eliminate false suspects systematically
3. Identify the actual root cause
4. Provide a comprehensive fix with verification steps

## Expected Output
- Hypothesis exploration (list 3-5 possible causes)
- Systematic elimination process (why each suspect can be ruled out or confirmed)
- Root cause identification with evidence
- Solution design (multi-phase if needed)
- Verification strategy

## Evaluation Criteria
You will be evaluated on:
1. **Quality**: Did you identify the root cause correctly?
2. **Reasoning Depth**: Did you explore multiple hypotheses and eliminate false suspects?
3. **Actionability**: Can a developer implement your solution immediately?

## Additional Hints
- The error message may be misleading
- Consider what happens between client and server during a save operation
- Think about data validation vs. authentication
- Database constraints might play a role
