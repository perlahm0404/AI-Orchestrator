You are designing a documentation architecture strategy for a multi-repository organization.

## Problem Statement
Your organization has 4 repositories with duplicated documentation:
1. **AI_Orchestrator** (execution engine, agents, orchestration)
2. **KareMatch** (therapist marketplace application)
3. **CredentialMate** (physician credentialing application)
4. **Knowledge_Vault** (Obsidian vault with strategic context)

Documentation is duplicated across all 4 locations, causing:
- Inconsistencies (same topic documented differently)
- Staleness (updates in one place, not others)
- Confusion (which doc is canonical?)
- Maintenance burden (update 4 places for every change)

## Current Duplication Examples

**Example 1: Email Classification**
- AI_Orchestrator: `docs/guides/EMAIL_CLASSIFICATION_IMPROVEMENTS.md` (implementation details)
- Knowledge_Vault: `AI-Engineering/01-AI-Orchestrator/Sessions/email-classification.md` (strategic context)
- CredentialMate: `docs/email-processing.md` (user guide)
- Shared: All three contain overlapping information

**Example 2: CME Rules Engine**
- AI_Orchestrator: `docs/decisions/ADR-001-CME-FIDELITY-YAML-JSON-SYNC.md` (technical decision)
- Knowledge_Vault: `AI-Engineering/02-CredentialMate/CME-Rules/overview.md` (architecture)
- CredentialMate: `docs/cme-rules.md` (implementation)
- KareMatch: `docs/cme-integration.md` (integration guide)

**Example 3: Agent Governance**
- AI_Orchestrator: `governance/contracts/*.yaml` (policy definitions)
- Knowledge_Vault: `AI-Engineering/01-AI-Orchestrator/Governance/overview.md` (strategic rationale)
- AI_Orchestrator: `docs/06-governance/README.md` (implementation guide)

## Repository Characteristics

**AI_Orchestrator**:
- Execution engine (runtime context)
- Changes frequently (daily commits)
- Technical implementation focus

**Knowledge_Vault**:
- Strategic context (long-term memory)
- Changes infrequently (weekly reviews)
- Cross-project learnings, decisions

**KareMatch / CredentialMate**:
- Application-specific (user-facing)
- Changes frequently (feature development)
- Product documentation focus

## Your Task
Design a documentation architecture that:

1. **Eliminates duplication** without losing important information
2. **Establishes ownership** (which repo owns which content?)
3. **Enables discovery** (how do users find the right doc?)
4. **Scales to 10+ repos** (future growth)
5. **Supports multiple audiences** (engineers, strategists, users)

## Expected Output
- Documentation layer model (strategic/tactical/operational or similar)
- Content ownership matrix (which repo owns what?)
- Cross-reference strategy (how docs point to each other)
- Migration plan (move content from where to where?)
- Maintenance protocol (how to keep docs in sync going forward)

## Evaluation Criteria
You will be evaluated on:
1. **Quality**: Does the architecture solve duplication without losing value?
2. **Reasoning Depth**: Did you consider different audience needs?
3. **Actionability**: Can the team implement this architecture?

## Constraints
- Cannot lose historical context (Knowledge_Vault preserves decisions)
- Cannot break agent workflows (AI_Orchestrator agents consult docs)
- Must support offline access (engineers work on planes)
- Must be searchable (grep, Obsidian search, IDE search)
- No external documentation platforms (must be git-based)

## Strategic Context
- Organization values institutional memory (don't delete historical docs)
- Multiple stakeholders (engineers, product, strategy)
- Fast-moving environment (daily changes)
- Multi-repo architecture is permanent (not consolidating repos)
