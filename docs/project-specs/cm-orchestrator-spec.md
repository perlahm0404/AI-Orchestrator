⏺ Staying in plan mode. I've written the comprehensive implementation plan to /Users/tmac/.claude/plans/polished-dreaming-snowglobe.md.

  The plan includes:
  - Layered governance architecture (HIPAA safety first, then Wiggum iteration control)
  - 4 implementation steps (Knowledge internalization, adapter fixes, env var harmonization, sync mechanism)
  - 7-day migration timeline with 20 hours total effort
  - Comprehensive testing strategy (unit tests, HIPAA compliance, smoke tests)
  - Rollback plan with backup/restore scripts
  - Sync mechanism for pulling future AI Orchestrator improvements

  Key findings:
  - Stop hook already merged (no work needed!)
  - AUTONOMOUS_MODE already standardized (no work needed!)
  - Only 2 adapter imports to fix (ralph/watcher.py, remove parallel_agents.py)
  - Knowledge Objects just need copy script

  Would you like me to:
  1. Add more detail to any section?
  2. Explore alternative approaches?
  3. Answer questions about the plan?
  4. Exit plan mode and proceed with implementation?

✻ Baked for 20m 52s

❯ I want all the agentic capabilities inside ai orch (new feature build, qa, test, etc) should we replicate? Also, what if i want to build    
  program manager and project manager agents, Q: should i build it? if yes, build inside ai orch or native to credentialmate                  

⏺ Great strategic question! Let me stay in plan mode and analyze this architecture decision. This affects the entire internalization strategy.

⏺ Perfect! I've updated the plan with the agent architecture strategy. Here are the key findings:

  Summary: Agent Capabilities

  ✅ Already Replicated (No Action Needed)

  All core agentic capabilities ARE already in CredentialMate:
  - BugFixAgent ✅
  - CodeQualityAgent ✅
  - FeatureBuilderAgent ✅
  - TestWriterAgent ✅
  - BaseAgent protocol ✅
  - Factory with LocalAdapter ✅

  Answer to your question: Yes, replicate all core agents → Already done!

  🆕 New Agents (Program Manager, Project Manager)

  Recommendation: HYBRID Architecture

  Build base framework in AI Orchestrator:
  - base_program_manager.py - Common coordination patterns
  - base_project_manager.py - Universal task management (80% reusable)

  Build implementations native in CredentialMate:
  - program_manager.py - HIPAA-aware sprint planning
  - project_manager.py - PHI-safe task decomposition

  Why hybrid?
  - Core patterns are universal (all projects need coordination)
  - Domain logic is specific (HIPAA for CM, feature flags for KM)
  - Allows experimentation in AI Orch before production

  📐 Decision Matrix for Future Agents

  Score 5 factors (0-5 each), total determines placement:
  - 13-20 points → AI Orchestrator (universal, sync to all projects)
  - 6-12 points → Hybrid (base in AI Orch, extend in projects)
  - 0-5 points → Native to project (domain-specific only)

  🏗️ AI Orchestrator's New Role

  Identity: Framework Source + Research Vault (NOT execution environment)

  What it provides:
  - Core agent patterns (proven, tested)
  - Governance framework (Ralph, contracts, Wiggum)
  - Research lab (test new agents before production)
  - Knowledge sharing (cross-project learning)

  What it doesn't do:
  - ✗ Execute on projects directly
  - ✗ Handle project-specific logic
  - ✗ Store HIPAA/compliance code

  ⏱️ Timeline Impact

  Updated: 13 days (was 7 days)
  - Days 1-7: Core internalization (what we planned)
  - Days 8-10: Build base manager agents in AI Orch
  - Days 11-13: Implement CredentialMate managers

  ---
  Your Questions Answered

  Q: Should we replicate all agentic capabilities from AI Orch?
  A: Already done! All 4 core agents are in CredentialMate and working.

  Q: Should I build Program Manager and Project Manager agents?
  A: Yes! High value for coordinating autonomous work.

  Q: Build in AI Orch or native to CredentialMate?
  A: Hybrid - Base in AI Orch (reusable framework), Implementation in CredentialMate (HIPAA-aware logic).

 CredentialMate AI Orchestrator Internalization Plan

 Executive Summary

 Goal: Internalize AI Orchestrator governance into CredentialMate for standalone operation while maintaining sync capability with AI Orchestrator
  improvements.

 Strategy: Merge both governance systems through layering (not replacement), copy Knowledge Objects locally, harmonize on AUTONOMOUS_MODE, and
 create sync mechanism for future updates.

 Timeline: 5-7 days with comprehensive testing

 ---
 User Requirements

 - Gov Strategy: Keep both, merge capabilities (best of both worlds)
 - KO Storage: Copy locally, fully independent
 - Env Vars: Harmonize on AUTONOMOUS_MODE
 - Update Path: Maintain sync capability with AI Orchestrator

 Current State Analysis

 CredentialMate Native Governance (Pre-Existing)

 Location: /Users/tmac/credentialmate/

 Strengths:
 - 11 blocking PreToolUse hooks (database-deletion-guardian, golden-path-guard-v3, TDD-enforcer, etc.)
 - HIPAA-focused safety (5-layer database deletion policy, PHI detection)
 - Trust registry with graduated autonomy (L0-L4)
 - Golden pathway protection (upload→process→view workflow)
 - Service contract validation (SSOT for docker-compose.yml)
 - Uses AUTONOMOUS_MODE environment variable

 Hook Registration: .claude/settings.local.json
 - 11 PreToolUse hooks (execute BEFORE tool runs)
 - 2 PostToolUse hooks (execute AFTER tool runs)

 AI Orchestrator Governance (Replicated)

 Location: /Users/tmac/credentialmate/ (replicated from AI_Orchestrator)

 Strengths:
 - Wiggum iteration control (completion signals, retry budgets 15-50)
 - Ralph verification (PASS/FAIL/BLOCKED verdicts with HIPAA checks)
 - Knowledge Object system (approved/drafts, 10.5x ROI)
 - Bug discovery (Ruff, MyPy, Pytest, Guardrails)
 - Multi-agent orchestration
 - Session resume capability

 Current Status:
 - ✅ ralph/, governance/, orchestration/, agents/, discovery/ - WORKING
 - ✅ autonomous_loop.py, cli.py - WORKING
 - ⚠️ knowledge/ - Symlinked (needs internalization)
 - ❌ ralph/watcher.py, orchestration/parallel_agents.py - Broken (adapter imports)

 ---
 Critical Conflicts Identified

 1. Stop Hook Duplication
   - Both have governance/hooks/stop_hook.py with different logic
   - CredentialMate: R/O/A prompt for HIPAA guardrails
   - AI Orchestrator: Wiggum completion signals + iteration budgets
   - Solution: Already merged! Current stop_hook.py has both (lines 1-100)
 2. Knowledge Symlink
   - knowledge/ → /Users/tmac/Vaults/AI_Orchestrator/knowledge
   - Creates cross-repo dependency
   - Solution: Copy directory locally, remove symlink
 3. Adapter Import Errors
   - ralph/watcher.py (line 42): from adapters import get_adapter
   - orchestration/parallel_agents.py (line 24): from adapters import get_adapter
   - Solution: Use LocalAdapter pattern (already working in agents/factory.py lines 84-93)
 4. Environment Variables
   - Both use different variable names
   - Solution: Harmonize on AUTONOMOUS_MODE (already in CredentialMate)

 Implementation Architecture

 Layered Governance Model

 ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
 │ Layer 1: PreToolUse Hooks (HIPAA Safety - FIRST)      │
 │ • database-deletion-guardian.py                        │
 │ • golden-path-guard-v3.py                             │
 │ • TDD-enforcer.py                                      │
 │ • 8 other native hooks                                 │
 │ Priority: HIGHEST (blocks before action executes)      │
 └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                          ↓
 ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
 │ Action Executes (Write, Edit, Bash, etc.)             │
 └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                          ↓
 ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
 │ Layer 2: PostToolUse Hooks (Iteration Control - AFTER)│
 │ • governance/hooks/stop_hook.py (ALREADY MERGED)      │
 │   - Wiggum completion signals                          │
 │   - Iteration budgets                                  │
 │   - Ralph verification (includes HIPAA)                │
 │   - R/O/A prompt on BLOCKED                           │
 │ Priority: SECONDARY (quality + iteration after safety) │
 └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

 Key Insight: PreToolUse hooks prevent bad actions. PostToolUse hooks enforce quality AFTER action succeeds. Sequential layering preserves HIPAA
 safety while adding Wiggum iteration control.

 ---
 Implementation Steps

 Step 1: Knowledge Object Internalization

 Goal: Remove symlink, copy directory locally

 Script: scripts/internalize_knowledge.sh

 #!/bin/bash
 # Remove symlink
 rm /Users/tmac/credentialmate/knowledge

 # Copy entire directory
 cp -R /Users/tmac/Vaults/AI_Orchestrator/knowledge /Users/tmac/credentialmate/

 # Create CredentialMate-specific config
 cat > /Users/tmac/credentialmate/knowledge/config/credentialmate.json << 'EOF'
 {
   "project": "credentialmate",
   "auto_approval": {
     "enabled": true,
     "thresholds": {"min_iterations": 2, "max_iterations": 10}
   },
   "tag_aliases": {
     "hipaa": ["phi", "protected-health-information", "compliance"]
   }
 }
 EOF

 echo "✓ Knowledge Objects internalized"

 Metrics Decision: Start fresh (don't copy metrics.json). CredentialMate-specific metrics will build quickly.

 ---
 Step 2: Adapter Import Fixes

 Goal: Fix broken adapter imports in 2 files

 Fix 1: ralph/watcher.py (line 42)

 Problem: from adapters import get_adapter

 Solution: Use LocalAdapter pattern from agents/factory.py

 # Add at top of ralph/watcher.py after imports
 class LocalAdapter:
     def __init__(self, app_ctx):
         self.app_context = app_ctx
     def get_context(self):
         return self.app_context

 # Replace line 42
 # OLD: from adapters import get_adapter
 # NEW: from ralph.config import APP_CONTEXT

 # Update main() function
 def main():
     # Use APP_CONTEXT directly
     adapter = LocalAdapter(APP_CONTEXT)
     # ... rest of watcher logic

 Fix 2: orchestration/parallel_agents.py

 Problem: from adapters import get_adapter (line 24)

 Solution: REMOVE FILE ENTIRELY

 Parallel agents require cross-repo adapter registry. For CredentialMate standalone:
 - Single-agent iteration loop is sufficient
 - orchestration/iteration_loop.py already handles sequential execution
 - No need for parallel orchestration in standalone mode

 rm /Users/tmac/credentialmate/orchestration/parallel_agents.py

 ---
 Step 3: Environment Variable Harmonization

 Goal: Use AUTONOMOUS_MODE everywhere

 Files to Check:
 - governance/kill_switch.py - Already uses AUTONOMOUS_MODE ✅
 - autonomous_loop.py - Already uses AUTONOMOUS_MODE ✅
 - autonomy-toggle.sh - Already uses AUTONOMOUS_MODE ✅

 No changes needed! CredentialMate already standardized on AUTONOMOUS_MODE.

 ---
 Step 4: Sync Mechanism Implementation

 Goal: Create sync script for future AI Orchestrator updates

 File 1: .aibrain/sync-manifest.yaml

 Defines sync rules:
 - syncable_files: Core logic (ralph/engine.py, orchestration/iteration_loop.py, agents/*.py)
 - protected_files: CredentialMate-specific (ralph/config.py, ralph/hipaa_config.yaml, governance/contracts/*.yaml)
 - merge_strategy_files: Require manual review (agents/factory.py)

 File 2: scripts/sync-from-orchestrator.sh

 Main sync script with:
 - Dry-run mode (--dry-run)
 - Auto-approve mode (--yes)
 - Verbose mode (--verbose)
 - Backup before sync
 - Test validation after sync
 - Auto-rollback on test failure

 Usage:
 # Preview changes
 ./scripts/sync-from-orchestrator.sh --dry-run --verbose

 # Interactive sync
 ./scripts/sync-from-orchestrator.sh

 # Auto-sync all
 ./scripts/sync-from-orchestrator.sh --yes

 File 3: sync_tools/filter_changed_files.py

 Python helper to categorize files based on manifest rules.

 File 4: docs/sync-from-orchestrator.md

 User documentation:
 - When to sync (weekly, on-demand)
 - How to sync (commands)
 - What gets synced (categories)
 - Troubleshooting (rollback, conflicts)

 ---
 Testing Strategy

 Unit Tests (tests/test_governance_merge.py)

 Create comprehensive tests:

 def test_native_hooks_still_work():
     """Verify all 11 PreToolUse hooks registered and functional."""
     # Test database-deletion-guardian blocks production deletions
     # Test golden-path-guard asks for docker-compose changes
     # Test TDD-enforcer blocks production code without tests
     pass

 def test_ai_orchestrator_systems_work():
     """Verify AI Orchestrator components functional."""
     # Test Ralph runs without adapter errors
     # Test agents/factory uses LocalAdapter correctly
     # Test autonomous_loop.py starts without crashes
     pass

 def test_knowledge_objects_local():
     """Verify Knowledge Objects fully local."""
     # Test knowledge/ is real directory (not symlink)
     # Test KO search works
     # Test CredentialMate config exists
     pass

 def test_stop_hook_merged():
     """Verify stop hook has both Wiggum + HIPAA logic."""
     # Test completion signal detection
     # Test iteration budget enforcement
     # Test Ralph verification runs
     # Test HIPAA-specific R/O/A prompt
     pass

 HIPAA Compliance Tests (tests/test_hipaa_compliance.py)

 CRITICAL: These tests MUST pass before deployment.

 def test_hipaa_violations_blocked():
     """Verify HIPAA violations escalate to BLOCKED verdict."""
     # Test PHI logging blocked by Ralph
     # Test production DB deletions permanently blocked
     pass

 def test_golden_pathway_protected():
     """Verify golden pathway workflow always works."""
     # Test upload→S3→worker→Bedrock→review flow
     # Test S3 bucket config validation
     pass

 Manual Smoke Tests

 Checklist:
 - Native hooks work (11/11 pass)
 - AI Orchestrator systems work (Ralph, bug discovery, KO search, autonomous loop)
 - Stop hook merge works (completion signals, R/O/A prompts)
 - HIPAA compliance maintained (database guardian, PHI detection)
 - Autonomous mode toggle works (./autonomy-toggle.sh on/off/status)
 - Knowledge Objects accessible (no symlink, local directory)
 - Sync script works (--dry-run mode)

 ---
 Rollback Plan

 Backup Script

 scripts/backup_before_merge.sh:
 #!/bin/bash
 BACKUP_DIR=".aibrain/backups/$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"
 mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR"

 # Backup critical files
 cp -R governance/ "$BACKUP_DIR/"
 cp -R knowledge/ "$BACKUP_DIR/"
 cp ralph/watcher.py "$BACKUP_DIR/"
 cp orchestration/parallel_agents.py "$BACKUP_DIR/" 2>/dev/null || true

 echo "✓ Backup created: $BACKUP_DIR"

 Rollback Script

 scripts/rollback_merge.sh:
 #!/bin/bash
 BACKUP_DIR="$1"

 if [ -z "$BACKUP_DIR" ]; then
     echo "Usage: ./rollback_merge.sh /path/to/backup"
     exit 1
 fi

 # Restore all files
 cp -R "$BACKUP_DIR"/* .

 echo "✓ Rollback complete from: $BACKUP_DIR"

 Verification Checklist

 After implementation, verify:

 Standalone Operation

 - Can run without /Users/tmac/Vaults/AI_Orchestrator/ present
 - No symlinks to AI_Orchestrator
 - No adapter imports
 - Knowledge Objects fully local

 Governance Integration

 - All 11 PreToolUse hooks registered in .claude/settings.local.json
 - Stop hook runs after Write/Edit/Bash tools
 - Ralph verification includes HIPAA checks
 - AUTONOMOUS_MODE environment variable works

 Autonomous Systems

 - python cli.py discover-bugs works
 - python cli.py autonomous --max-iterations 50 works
 - ./autonomy-toggle.sh on/off/status works
 - Work queue processing completes

 Sync Capability

 - ./scripts/sync-from-orchestrator.sh --dry-run works
 - Manifest categorizes files correctly
 - Backup created before sync
 - Tests run after sync
 - Rollback works if tests fail

 Agent Architecture Strategy

 Current Agent Status

 Already Replicated in CredentialMate ✅:
 - BugFixAgent (bugfix.py)
 - CodeQualityAgent (codequality.py)
 - FeatureBuilderAgent (featurebuilder.py)
 - TestWriterAgent (testwriter.py)
 - BaseAgent protocol (base.py)
 - Agent factory with LocalAdapter (factory.py)

 Verdict: All core agentic capabilities ARE already in CredentialMate!

 Recommended Architecture: Hybrid (Core vs Specialized)

 AI Orchestrator = Framework Source
 ├─ Core Agents (Universal, Proven)
 │  ├─ BugFixAgent ────────► sync to projects
 │  ├─ CodeQualityAgent ───► sync to projects
 │  ├─ FeatureBuilderAgent ► sync to projects
 │  └─ TestWriterAgent ────► sync to projects
 │
 └─ Base Abstractions (New agents)
    ├─ BaseProjectManager ─► projects extend
    └─ BaseProgramManager ─► projects extend

 CredentialMate = Standalone + Specialized
 ├─ Synced Core Agents (From AI Orch) ✅
 │  └─ All 4 agents working with LocalAdapter
 │
 └─ Native Specialized Agents (NEW)
    ├─ program_manager.py (HIPAA-aware coordination)
    ├─ project_manager.py (PHI-safe task management)
    └─ compliance_validator.py (HIPAA-specific)

 Decision Matrix: Where to Build New Agents

 Score each factor 1-5, total determines placement:
 - 13-20 points → AI Orchestrator (universal, sync to projects)
 - 6-12 points → Hybrid (base in AI Orch, impl in project)
 - 0-5 points → Native to project

 Factors:
 1. Generality (works for all projects?)
 2. Stability (pattern proven?)
 3. Customization (how much project-specific logic?)
 4. HIPAA Sensitivity (handles PHI/compliance?)
 5. Reusability (3+ projects benefit?)

 New Agent Placement Decisions

 Program Manager Agent

 Score: 11 → HYBRID

 Build:
 - Framework: AI_Orchestrator/agents/base_program_manager.py
 - Implementation: credentialmate/agents/program_manager.py

 Rationale:
 - Sprint planning differs per project (HIPAA for CM, feature flags for KM)
 - Base protocol captures common coordination patterns
 - Projects customize for domain-specific needs

 Capabilities:
 - Multi-project sprint planning
 - Resource allocation across teams
 - HIPAA-aware user story management (for CredentialMate)
 - Cross-project dependency tracking

 Project Manager Agent

 Score: 12 → HYBRID (leaning AI Orch)

 Build:
 - Framework: AI_Orchestrator/agents/base_project_manager.py (80% of logic)
 - Extension: credentialmate/agents/project_manager.py (HIPAA validation layer)

 Rationale:
 - Task breakdown is 80% universal
 - CredentialMate adds HIPAA validation (tasks don't expose PHI)
 - High reusability across projects

 Capabilities:
 - Epic → Feature → Task decomposition
 - Work queue generation
 - Agent selection (route to BugFix vs Feature vs Quality)
 - Dependency graph management

 AI Orchestrator's New Role

 Post-Internalization Identity: Framework Source + Research Vault

 PRIMARY: Governance Framework Source of Truth
 - Core agents (proven patterns)
 - Ralph verification engine
 - Governance contracts
 - Orchestration patterns (Wiggum)

 SECONDARY: Multi-Project Learning Repository
 - Knowledge Objects (cross-project patterns)
 - Session reflections
 - Metrics aggregation

 RESEARCH: Agent Experimentation Lab
 - Test new agents before production
 - A/B test governance policies
 - Validate on AI_Brain vault (30+ repos)

 NOT IN SCOPE:
 - ✗ Direct execution on projects (standalone operation)
 - ✗ Project-specific business logic
 - ✗ HIPAA/domain compliance

 Migration Impact

 Additional Steps for Manager Agents (+6 days):

 1. Knowledge Internalization (1 day) - Copy knowledge/ directory
 2. Base Manager Agents (2 days) - Create in AI Orch
 3. CredentialMate Implementations (3 days) - Extend base agents

 Updated Timeline: 13 days (was 7 days)

 Expected Outcome

 After implementation:

 CredentialMate

 - Standalone: Operates fully independently (no cross-repo dependencies)
 - All Core Agents: BugFix, CodeQuality, Feature, Test working ✅
 - New Manager Agents: Program Manager + Project Manager (HIPAA-aware)
 - Merged Governance: All 11 native hooks + AI Orchestrator governance
 - Zero Dependencies: No cross-repo imports, no symlinks
 - HIPAA Compliant: All safety guards maintained
 - Sync Ready: Can pull AI Orchestrator improvements with single command
 - Production Ready: Tested, documented, rollback plan in place

 AI Orchestrator

 - Plan Reference: Complete internalization plan stored in docs/plans/
 - Internalization Guide: Generic guide for future projects
 - Base Manager Agents: BaseProjectManager, BaseProgramManager ready for reuse
 - Template: KareMatch or future projects can follow same pattern
 - Institutional Memory: Decisions and learnings documented in DECISIONS.md
