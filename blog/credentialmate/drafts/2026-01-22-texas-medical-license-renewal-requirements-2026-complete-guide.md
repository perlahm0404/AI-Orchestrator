Understanding Texas medical license renewal requirements is essential—the TMB receives approximately 6,000 complaints annually, resulting in 350-400 disciplinary actions ranging from public reprimands to license revocation. This guide covers everything you need to know about Texas medical license renewal in 2026, including fees, CME requirements, and compliance deadlines.

## CME Requirements for Texas Physicians

Texas requires physicians to complete continuing medical education as a condition of registration renewal. Requirements are established under Texas Administrative Code, Title 22, Part 9, Chapter 166.

### Basic CME Requirements

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| Total Hours | 24 hours per biennial registration period |
| Credit Type | AMA PRA Category 1 or equivalent |
| Mandatory Topics | See below |
| Documentation | Retain for 4 years |

### Mandatory CME Topics

Texas requires specific CME topics as part of the 24-hour requirement:

| Topic | Hours | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Ethics | 2 | Medical ethics or professional responsibility |
| Pain Management/Opioid Prescribing | 2 | Required for DEA-registered physicians |
| Human Trafficking | 1 | Recognizing and reporting |

**New for 2025**: Effective September 1, 2025, the Texas Medical Board must establish rules requiring licensees to complete nutrition training based on guidelines from the Texas Nutrition Advisory Committee.

### CME Compliance and Reporting

Texas uses a self-certification model:

1. **At Renewal**: Certify completion of required CME hours
2. **Random Audits**: TMB conducts random audits of CME compliance
3. **Documentation**: Maintain certificates and records for 4 years
4. **Audit Response**: If audited, provide documentation within 30 days

### Penalties for CME Non-Compliance

Failure to comply with CME requirements invokes:

- Late registration monetary penalties
- Administrative penalties determined by the Disciplinary Process Review Committee
- Potential formal investigation
- Public disciplinary action

The TMB takes CME compliance seriously—with approximately 2,800 investigations opened annually from 6,000 complaints, CME violations are a common trigger for board attention.

## Texas Registration Renewal Process

### Renewal Timeline

Texas provides a **30-day grace period** after your registration expiration date, but practicing during this period may still expose you to risk.

| Timeframe | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| 60 days before | TMB sends renewal notice |
| 30 days before | Recommended submission deadline |
| Expiration date | Registration expires |
| 30 days after | Grace period ends—late fees apply |
