# Pennsylvania Medical License Renewal: MD and DO Requirements

## Introduction

Pennsylvania operates a unique dual-board system for physician licensing: the **State Board of Medicine** governs MD (allopathic) physicians, while the **State Board of Osteopathic Medicine** governs DO (osteopathic) physicians. Both require biennial renewal with 100 hours of CME—among the highest requirements in the nation.

Understanding which board regulates your license and the specific requirements for your credential type is essential for Pennsylvania physicians. This guide covers medical license renewal for both MDs and DOs in Pennsylvania, including the critical mandatory training requirements.

## Pennsylvania's Dual Board System

### Renewal Cycle

Pennsylvania uses biennial renewal with all licenses expiring October 31 of even-numbered years:
- 2024: October 31, 2024
- 2026: October 31, 2026
- 2028: October 31, 2028

## Online Renewal Process

### Using the PALS System

Pennsylvania uses the **Pennsylvania Licensing System (PALS)** for online renewals:

1. **Access PALS**: Visit pals.pa.gov
2. **Create/Login**: Use your account credentials
3. **Select License**: Choose your medical license
4. **Complete Application**:
   - Verify personal information
   - Update address if needed
   - Answer disclosure questions
   - Certify CME completion (100 hours including child abuse)
5. **Pay Fee**: Submit payment electronically
6. **Receive Confirmation**: Save receipt

### License Verification

Verify your license status at:
https://www.pals.pa.gov/

## Practicing Without Renewal

### Pennsylvania Penalties

Under 49 Pa. Code § 25.271:

> "A penalty fee will be imposed on a licensee who continued to practice without having timely renewed his license."

| Consequence | Impact |
|-------------|--------|
| Penalty fee | Additional cost |
| Practice violation | Disciplinary exposure |
| Unlicensed practice | Criminal potential |

### What to Do If Renewal Is Late

1. **Stop practicing** if past deadline without grace period
2. **Submit renewal immediately** with any late fees
3. **Do not see patients** until license confirmed active
4. **Contact board** if questions about status

## Special Considerations for DOs

### Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment (OMT)

DO licenses in Pennsylvania authorize OMT as part of scope of practice. CME in OMT may be applicable toward requirements.

### AOA vs. AMA Credits

| Credit Type | Acceptance |
|-------------|------------|
| AOA Category 1-A | Fully accepted |
| AOA Category 1-B | Generally accepted |
| AMA PRA Category 1 | Usually accepted for DOs |

**Verify with Osteopathic Board** for specific credit acceptance.

## Multi-State Practice Considerations

### IMLC Participation

Pennsylvania participates in the Interstate Medical Licensure Compact (IMLC):

- **IMLC available**: Yes
- **SPL eligible**: Yes
- **Benefits**: Expedited multi-state licensing

### Reciprocity

Pennsylvania may consider licenses from other states during initial application but requires Pennsylvania-specific renewal thereafter.

## Child Abuse Training Resources

| Provider Type | Examples |
|---------------|----------|

### Training Content Requirements

## Key Takeaways

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is there a difference between MD and DO license renewal in Pennsylvania?

The requirements are largely similar—both require 100 hours of CME per biennial period including 2 hours of child abuse training. The main difference is which board oversees your license: State Board of Medicine for MDs, State Board of Osteopathic Medicine for DOs.

### Why does Pennsylvania require 100 hours of CME?

Pennsylvania has one of the highest CME requirements in the nation. The state legislature and medical boards determined this level necessary to ensure physician competency. The 100-hour requirement has been in place for many years.

### What happens if I don't complete the child abuse training?

You cannot renew your Pennsylvania license without completing the mandatory 2-hour child abuse recognition and reporting training. This is a non-negotiable requirement under Pennsylvania law.

### Can I use AMA credits as a DO in Pennsylvania?

Generally, yes. The State Board of Osteopathic Medicine typically accepts AMA PRA Category 1 credits. However, verify current policy with the board, as AOA Category 1-A credits are the primary standard for DOs.

### When do Pennsylvania medical licenses expire?

All Pennsylvania medical licenses expire on October 31 of even-numbered years (2024, 2026, 2028, etc.), regardless of when the license was originally issued.
