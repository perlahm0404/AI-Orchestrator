# New York Medical License Renewal: Registration and Requirements

## Introduction

New York physicians operate under a unique licensing system that differs significantly from most other states. The New York State Education Department (NYSED) Office of the Professions oversees physician licensing through a **triennial registration system**—and notably, **New York does not require CME for license renewal**.

This distinction makes New York an outlier among the 50 states, most of which mandate 20-100+ hours of CME per renewal cycle. Understanding New York's registration-based system is essential for physicians practicing in the state or considering licensure there. This guide covers everything you need to know about New York medical license renewal in 2026.

## Understanding New York's Unique System

### License vs. Registration

New York separates the concepts of licensure and registration:

| Concept | Description | Duration |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **License** | Permanent credential issued after meeting initial requirements | Lifetime (does not expire) |
| **Registration** | Authorization to practice, renewed periodically | 3 years (triennial) |

In New York, your medical **license** is permanent—it doesn't expire. However, you must maintain an active **registration** to legally practice medicine. The registration is what you renew every three years.

### No CME Required for Registration Renewal

**New York is one of the only states that does not require continuing medical education for license/registration renewal.**

| State | CME Required | Hours per Cycle |
|-------|--------------|-----------------|
| California | Yes | 50 hours/2 years |
| Texas | Yes | 24 hours/2 years |
| Florida | Yes | 40 hours/2 years |
| **New York** | **No** | **0 hours** |
| Pennsylvania | Yes | 100 hours/2 years |

This doesn't mean CME isn't important—hospitals, insurance companies, and specialty boards still require ongoing education. But the state registration renewal does not mandate it.

## New York Medical Registration Fees (as of January 2026)

NYSED sets registration fees under New York Education Law, Article 131.

| Fee Type | Amount | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Triennial Registration (Active) | $736 | Every 3 years |
| Limited Permit | Varies | For specific purposes |
| Restoration (Lapsed Registration) | $736 + fees | Plus any back registrations |
| Verification Letter | $35 | Written verification |

### Fee Breakdown

The $736 triennial registration fee is higher than many states' biennial fees, but covers a three-year period rather than two years:

- **Annual equivalent**: ~$245/year
- **Compared to California**: $1,206/2 years = $603/year
- **Compared to Texas**: ~$491/2 years = ~$246/year

## Registration Renewal Process

### Online Renewal

New York offers online registration renewal through the NYSED portal:

1. **Access the Portal**: Visit [op.nysed.gov](https://www.op.nysed.gov)
2. **Log In**: Use your NY.gov ID credentials
3. **Select Renewal**: Navigate to your license and select "Renew Registration"
4. **Complete Application**: Answer required questions including:
   - Address verification
   - Disciplinary disclosures
   - Practice information
5. **Pay Fee**: Submit $736 via electronic payment
6. **Receive Confirmation**: Print and save your receipt

### Renewal Timeline

| Timeframe | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| 90 days before expiration | NYSED sends renewal notice |
| 60 days before | Recommended online renewal start |
| Expiration date | Registration lapses if not renewed |
| After expiration | Cannot legally practice |

### What You Need for Renewal

- NY.gov ID login credentials
- Current mailing address
- Social Security Number (for verification)
- Payment method
- Disclosure of any disciplinary actions since last registration

## Practicing Without Active Registration

Even though your New York medical license is permanent, practicing without an active registration is illegal under Education Law Section 6512.

### Consequences of Lapsed Registration

| Type | Consequence |
|------|-------------|
| Legal | Practicing without registration is a Class E felony |
| Civil | Malpractice exposure, uninsured practice |
| Professional | Board disciplinary action |
| Employment | Immediate termination from most positions |

### What If Your Registration Lapses?

If your registration expires:

1. **Stop practicing immediately**—do not see patients
2. **Do not prescribe medications**—DEA authority linked to active registration
3. **Submit renewal application** with any required fees
4. **Wait for confirmation** before resuming practice
5. **Notify employers** of your registration status

## New York Does Not Have a Grace Period

Unlike some states that offer 30-90 day grace periods, **New York provides no grace period** for registration renewal.

| State | Grace Period |
|-------|--------------|
| **New York** | **None** |
| California | None |
| Texas | 30 days |
| Florida | 30 days |
| Maryland | None |

On your expiration date, your authority to practice ends at midnight. Ensure your renewal is processed and confirmed before that time.

## CME Considerations for New York Physicians

While New York doesn't require CME for registration renewal, physicians should consider:

### Hospital Credentialing

Most New York hospitals require CME for medical staff privileges:

- Typical requirement: 50-100 hours per credentialing cycle
- Specialty-specific requirements may apply
- Joint Commission accreditation standards

### Specialty Board Certification

Medical specialty boards require ongoing education:

- ABMS Maintenance of Certification (MOC)
- Specialty-specific requirements
- Knowledge assessments and practice improvement

### Insurance Considerations

Malpractice insurers may require CME:

- Policy renewal requirements
- Risk management credits
- Discount eligibility

### Multi-State Practice

If you practice in other states, those states' CME requirements apply:

- IMLC licenses require meeting each state's standards
- Telemedicine across state lines follows patient's state rules

## License Verification

### Verify Your Status

### Verification for Employers/Credentialing

The NYSED provides:

- Online public verification (free)
- Written verification letters ($35)
- Primary source verification for credentialing

## Inactive Registration Option

New York offers options for physicians not actively practicing:

### Voluntary Surrender

You may voluntarily surrender your registration if:

- Retiring from practice
- Moving permanently out of state
- No longer practicing medicine

### Restoration After Surrender

To restore a surrendered registration:

1. Submit restoration application
2. Pay required fees ($736 plus any back registration fees)
3. Provide evidence of continued competency if significant time has passed
4. Complete any required interviews or assessments

## Key Takeaways

- **New York uses a triennial (3-year) registration system**—license is permanent, registration must be renewed
- **Registration fee is $736** per three-year period
- **No CME required** for state registration renewal (unique among states)
- **No grace period**—registration expires at midnight on expiration date
- **Hospitals and specialty boards** still require CME even though state doesn't
- **Practice without active registration** is a Class E felony

## Conclusion

New York's physician licensing system is unique in its separation of permanent licensure from triennial registration and its lack of state-mandated CME requirements. While this may seem simpler than other states, physicians must still maintain CME for hospital privileges, board certification, and insurance requirements.

Use CredentialMate to track your New York registration expiration, manage CME for hospital and specialty board requirements, and ensure you never miss a renewal deadline—even without state CME mandates.
