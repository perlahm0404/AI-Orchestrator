# Medical License Renewal Fees Comparison 2026: Lowest to Highest

## Introduction

Medical license renewal fees vary dramatically across the United States—from as low as $60 in Wisconsin to over $1,200 in California. For physicians practicing in multiple states, these fees can add up to thousands of dollars annually. Understanding the fee landscape helps with financial planning and, for those with flexibility, can inform decisions about where to maintain active licenses.

This comprehensive guide compares medical license renewal fees across all 50 states for 2026, organized from lowest to highest, with additional context on what you get for your fees in each state.

## Fee Comparison Overview

### At a Glance: Fee Ranges

| Category | Fee Range | States |

### Factors Affecting Total Cost

When comparing fees, consider:
- **Renewal cycle**: Biennial (2-year) vs. triennial (3-year)
- **Mandatory additional fees**: Some states add statutory fees
- **CME costs**: Higher CME requirements = higher total cost
- **Late fees**: Vary significantly by state

## True Cost Comparison: Fee + CME Requirements

### Accounting for CME Costs

State fees alone don't tell the whole story. Consider CME costs:

| State | Fee | CME Hours | Est. CME Cost* | Total Est. Cost |
|-------|-----|-----------|----------------|-----------------|
| New York | $736/3yr | 0 | $0 | $736/3yr |
| Wisconsin | $60/2yr | Varies | ~$500 | ~$560/2yr |
| California | $1,206/2yr | 50 | ~$500 | ~$1,706/2yr |
| Pennsylvania | Varies/2yr | 100 | ~$1,000 | Higher total |
| Texas | $491/2yr | 24 | ~$250 | ~$741/2yr |

*CME cost estimates based on ~$10-15 per credit hour average

### Annual Equivalent Total Cost

| State | Annual License Cost | Annual CME Cost | Total Annual |
|-------|--------------------|-----------------| -------------|
| New York | ~$245 | $0 | ~$245 |
| Wisconsin | ~$30 | ~$250 | ~$280 |
| Texas | ~$246 | ~$125 | ~$371 |
| Florida | $180 | ~$200 | ~$380 |
| California | $603 | ~$250 | ~$853 |
| Pennsylvania | Varies | ~$500 | Higher |

## Multi-State Practice Considerations

### Cost of Multiple Licenses

For physicians with licenses in multiple states:

**Example: 3-State Practice**

| State | Biennial Fee |
|-------|--------------|
| California | $1,206 |
| Texas | $491 |
| Florida | $360 |
| **Total (2-year)** | **$2,057** |
| **Annual** | **~$1,029** |

Plus IMLC application fee (~$700 one-time) if applicable.

### Strategies to Minimize Costs

1. **Consider inactive status**: For states where you're not actively practicing
2. **Time renewals strategically**: Spread costs across years when possible
3. **Use IMLC**: One application fee covers multiple state applications
4. **Evaluate necessity**: Do you need all your current licenses?

## State-Specific Fee Details

### California (Highest)

| Fee Type | Amount |
|----------|--------|
| Biennial renewal | $1,206 |
| Late (0-30 days) | +$120.60 (10%) |
| Late (90+ days) | +$603 (50%) |
| **Maximum total** | **$1,809** |

**What you get**: Active license in largest state market, no mandatory CME topics (just 50 hours total)

### Texas

| Fee Type | Amount |
|----------|--------|
| Biennial renewal | ~$491 |
| Components | SB104, PMP, NPDB, PHP, OPP |
| Late fees | Varies |

**What you get**: Second-largest market, only 24 CME hours required

### Florida

| Fee Type | Amount |
|----------|--------|
| Biennial renewal | $360 |
| Inactive | $180 |
| Reactivation | $100 + $360 |

**What you get**: Third-largest market, but extensive mandatory CME topics

### New York

| Fee Type | Amount |
|----------|--------|
| Triennial registration | $736 |
| Late fees | Varies |

**What you get**: Major market, NO CME requirement (unique among large states)

### Wisconsin (Lowest)

| Fee Type | Amount |
|----------|--------|
| Biennial renewal | $60 |

**What you get**: Lowest fee in nation, smaller market

## Inactive License Fee Comparison

For physicians maintaining licenses in states where they're not actively practicing:

| State | Active Fee | Inactive Fee | Savings |
|-------|------------|--------------|---------|
| Florida | $360 | $180 | 50% |
| California | $1,206 | $603 | 50% |
| Some states | Full fee | No inactive option | N/A |

**Consider inactive status if**:
- Not currently seeing patients in that state
- No immediate plans to practice there
- Want to maintain license for future flexibility

## Fee Trends

### Historical Context

Medical license fees have generally increased over time:
- Reflecting inflation
- Supporting board operations
- Funding enforcement activities
- Supporting healthcare workforce programs

### Recent Changes

Some states have adjusted fees:
- **Texas**: Fee structure modified to include more component fees
- **California**: Includes mandatory program support fees

## Key Takeaways

- **Lowest fee**: Wisconsin at $60 biennial
- **Highest fee**: California at $1,206 biennial
- **Best value (major market)**: New York—$736 triennial with NO CME required
- **True cost includes CME**: Factor in CME costs for accurate comparison
- **Multi-state practice adds up**: Budget $1,000+ annually for 3+ state licenses
- **Inactive status saves money**: 50% savings in many states

## Conclusion

Medical license renewal fees represent a significant professional expense, especially for physicians practicing in multiple states. While California's $1,206 biennial fee stands as the highest, the true cost comparison must include CME requirements and renewal cycle length.

For multi-state practitioners, the IMLC offers efficiencies in the application process, though individual state fees still apply. Use CredentialMate to track all your license fees, renewal dates, and total professional expenses across all states where you practice.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Which state has the lowest medical license renewal fee?

Wisconsin has the lowest renewal fee at approximately $60 for biennial renewal. However, CME requirements still apply, so total cost includes educational expenses.

### Which state has the highest medical license renewal fee?

California has the highest fee at $1,206 for biennial renewal. With potential late fees of up to 50%, the maximum cost can reach $1,809.

### Why does New York have a high fee but no CME requirement?

New York operates under a unique system where the medical license is permanent but registration must be renewed triennially. The state chose not to mandate CME at the state level, though hospitals and specialty boards typically require it.

### How do I calculate the true cost of maintaining a license?

Add the license renewal fee plus estimated CME costs (approximately $10-15 per required credit hour) plus any mandatory topic course fees. Divide by the renewal cycle years for an annual equivalent.

### Are there ways to reduce medical license costs?

Consider: (1) Inactive status for states where you're not practicing, (2) Evaluating whether you need all current licenses, (3) Using free CME resources to reduce educational costs, (4) Timing renewals to spread costs.
