# Locum Tenens Licensing Requirements: Multi-State Guide for Physicians

## Introduction

Locum tenens physicians face unique licensing challenges. Working temporary assignments across multiple states means maintaining licenses in several jurisdictions, each with different fees, CME requirements, and renewal cycles. Understanding the licensing landscape—and using tools like the IMLC efficiently—can make locum work financially viable and administratively manageable.

This guide covers licensing strategies for locum tenens physicians, including multi-state planning, cost management, and maintaining compliance across jurisdictions.

## The Locum Tenens Licensing Challenge

### Why Licensing Is Complex

| Challenge | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| Multiple states | Each requires separate license |
| Different requirements | CME, fees, processes vary |
| Timing issues | Assignments may arise quickly |
| Cost accumulation | Fees multiply across states |
| Renewal tracking | Multiple deadlines to manage |

### Typical Locum License Portfolio

| Practice Pattern | Typical Licenses |
|------------------|------------------|
| Regional locums | 3-5 states |
| National locums | 8-15+ states |
| Specialty-focused | Varies by specialty demand |

## Licensing Options for Locums

### Option 1: Full State Licenses

**Standard approach**: Obtain full license in each state

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Unrestricted practice | Highest cost |
| Permanent (with renewal) | Longest application time |
| No limitations | Most complex tracking |

### Option 2: IMLC Expedited Licensing

**Use Interstate Medical Licensure Compact for eligible states**

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Process multiple states simultaneously | Not all states participate |
| Faster than traditional (~4-10 weeks) | Must meet eligibility requirements |
| Streamlined documentation | Upfront $700 application fee |

**IMLC Participation**: 42 states + DC + Guam (2026)

**Note**: Michigan withdraws March 28, 2026

### Option 3: Temporary/Locum Licenses

**Some states offer temporary or locum-specific licenses**

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Faster processing | Limited duration |
| Sometimes lower fee | May have restrictions |
| Good for one-off assignments | Not available in all states |

### Option 4: Telemedicine Registrations

**For remote/telehealth work**

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| May be cheaper than full license | Limited to telemedicine |
| Faster processing | Not all states offer |
| Good for hybrid locum work | Doesn't cover in-person care |

## State Licensing Strategies

### High-Demand Locum States

Focus licensing efforts on high-demand states:

| State | Demand Level | License Notes |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| California | Very High | IMLC not available, $1,206/2yr |
| Texas | High | IMLC available, ~$491/2yr |
| Florida | High | IMLC available, $360/2yr |
| New York | High | IMLC not available, $736/3yr, no CME |
| Rural states | High for locums | Often IMLC available |

### IMLC Strategy

For locum tenens, maximize IMLC:

1. **Establish SPL** in a participating state
2. **Apply for core states** through IMLC
3. **Add non-IMLC states** separately (CA, NY, FL)
4. **Time applications** for known assignment needs

### Cost-Benefit Analysis

| Approach | Year 1 Cost | Ongoing Annual |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| 5 states via IMLC | ~$2,500-3,500 | ~$1,000-1,500 |
| 5 states traditional | ~$3,000-4,500 | ~$1,000-1,500 |
| 10 states mixed | ~$5,000-8,000 | ~$2,000-3,000 |

## Managing Multiple Licenses

### Tracking Requirements

Each license has different:

| Requirement | Variation |
|-------------|-----------|
| Renewal cycle | Annual, biennial, triennial, quadrennial |
| CME hours | 0-200 hours per cycle |
| Mandatory topics | State-specific requirements |
| Fees | $60-1,206 per cycle |
| Deadlines | Birth month, fixed date, anniversary |

### Creating a License Matrix

| State | Expiration | CME Required | Mandatory Topics | Fee |
|-------|------------|--------------|------------------|-----|
| TX | 3/31/2028 | 24 | Ethics | $491 |
| FL | 1/31/2027 | 40 | Multiple | $360 |
| CA | Birth month 2027 | 50 | None specific | $1,206 |
| NY | 8/31/2028 | 0 | None | $736 |

### Meeting Multiple CME Requirements

**Strategy**: Complete the highest requirement, meeting all mandatory topics

| Approach | Method |
|----------|--------|
| Use highest total | If one state requires 100 hours, complete 100 |
| Track all mandatory topics | Some states have unique requirements |
| Document by state | Be able to show compliance for each |

## Cost Management

### License Maintenance Costs

| License Count | Estimated Annual Cost |
|---------------|----------------------|
| 3 licenses | $500-1,500 |
| 5 licenses | $1,000-2,500 |
| 10 licenses | $2,000-4,500 |
| 15 licenses | $3,000-6,000+ |

### Reducing Costs

| Strategy | Savings |
|----------|---------|
| Use IMLC | Efficiency in application |
| Inactive status | Reduce fees when not using |
| Let low-demand lapse | Don't maintain unused licenses |
| Time renewals | Don't rush with expedite fees |
| Free CME | Reduce education costs |

### Inactive Status Considerations

| State | Inactive Fee | Reactivation |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| California | ~$603 (50%) | Standard renewal |
| Florida | ~$180 (50%) | $100 + renewal fee |
| Some states | No inactive option | N/A |

**Consider inactive status** for licenses you don't expect to use for 1+ years.

## Assignment Planning

### Lead Time Requirements

Plan licensing around assignment possibilities:

| License Status | Lead Time Needed |
|----------------|------------------|
| Already licensed | Immediate |
| IMLC expedited | 4-10 weeks |
| Traditional application | 8-16 weeks |
| Temporary license | 2-4 weeks (some states) |

### Speculative Licensing

| Approach | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|
| Get licenses proactively | High-demand markets |
| Wait for assignment | Low-demand or expensive states |
| Use IMLC when opportunity arises | Multiple states needed quickly |

## Credentialing Considerations

### Hospital Privileging

Beyond state license, locums need:

| Requirement | Lead Time |
|-------------|-----------|
| Hospital privileges | 30-90 days |
| Medical staff approval | Varies |
| Background check | 2-4 weeks |
| Reference verification | 1-3 weeks |

### Streamlining Credentialing

| Tool | Benefit |
|------|---------|
| FCVS profile | Pre-verified credentials |
| CAQH ProView | Payer credentialing |
| CredentialMate | Centralized documentation |

## Locum Agency Support

### What Agencies Handle

| Service | Agency Role |
|---------|------------|
| Assignment matching | Primary function |
| Credentialing support | Often provided |
| License application assistance | Some agencies |
| Fee reimbursement | Sometimes |
| CME support | Rarely |

### What You're Responsible For

| Responsibility | Always Yours |
|----------------|-------------|
| License maintenance | Yes |
| CME completion | Yes |
| Address updates | Yes |
| Disclosure questions | Yes |
| Fee payment | Usually |

## Special Situations

### Emergency Licensing

Some states offer emergency or expedited licensing:

| Situation | Option |
|-----------|--------|
| Declared emergency | Temporary emergency license |
| Critical shortage | Expedited processing |
| Disaster response | Special provisions |

### Telemedicine + Locum Hybrid

| Approach | Use Case |
|----------|----------|

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How many state licenses do I need for locum tenens work?

It depends on your practice pattern. Regional locums might need 3-5 licenses, while national locums may maintain 10-15+. Focus on high-demand states and use IMLC to efficiently expand your portfolio.

### Can locum agencies get licenses for me?

Agencies can provide assistance and guidance, but you remain responsible for the license. Some agencies help with paperwork or reimburse fees, but the license is always in your name and your responsibility to maintain.

### Should I use IMLC or apply to states individually?

Use IMLC whenever possible—it's faster and allows processing multiple states simultaneously. For non-IMLC states (California, New York, Florida), you must apply traditionally.

### How do I manage CME for multiple states?

Complete the highest CME requirement among your licensed states, ensuring you also complete all mandatory topics for each state. Track by state to prove compliance during audits.

### Is locum tenens work worth the licensing costs?

For most locum physicians, yes. Higher locum rates typically offset licensing costs. A physician working 3-4 locum assignments per year in different states can easily justify maintaining multiple licenses.
