## CME Credit Types Accepted

Most states accept AMA PRA Category 1 credits, but acceptance of other credit types varies:

### Universally Accepted

- **AMA PRA Category 1**: Accepted by all states requiring CME
- **ACCME Direct Credits**: Widely accepted

### Variably Accepted

| Credit Type | Acceptance |
|-------------|------------|
| AOA Category 1-A | Accepted for DOs, some MDs |
| AAFP Prescribed | Widely accepted |
| Specialty Board MOC | Usually accepted, verify with state |
| Online CME | Generally accepted; some limits |
| Self-Study | Limits may apply |
| Teaching | Usually partial credit allowed |

## Special Considerations for Multi-State Practitioners

### Interstate Medical Licensure Compact (IMLC)

For physicians with IMLC licenses, CME requirements follow each state's rules:

- You must meet CME requirements for **each state** where you hold a license
- IMLC does not standardize CME requirements
- Track requirements separately for each state

**Important**: Michigan withdrawing from IMLC effective March 28, 2026.

### Telemedicine Across State Lines

When providing telemedicine to patients in other states:

- You must be licensed in the patient's state
- You must meet that state's CME requirements
- Document CME compliance for each state of practice

### Strategies for Multi-State Compliance

1. **Identify the most restrictive state**: Meet those requirements first
2. **Focus on overlapping topics**: Opioids, ethics courses count in multiple states
3. **Use ACCME-accredited providers**: Most broadly accepted
4. **Track by state**: Maintain separate logs for each state's requirements
5. **Plan mandatory topics first**: Complete state-specific requirements early

## 2025-2026 CME Requirement Changes

Several states have updated CME requirements recently:

### Texas (Effective September 2025)

New nutrition training requirement based on Texas Nutrition Advisory Committee guidelines.

### Alabama (Effective January 2025)

New professional boundaries course requirement:
- New licensees: Within 12 months of license issue
- Existing licensees: By December 31, 2025

### Maryland (Effective April 2022)

Implicit bias training now required for all renewing practitioners.

## Key Takeaways

- **CME requirements range from 0 to 150 hours** depending on state
- **New York is unique** in requiring no CME for license renewal
- **Florida has the most mandatory topics**: HIV, errors, DV, trafficking, controlled substances
- **Pennsylvania and Ohio have the highest biennial requirements** at 100 hours

## Conclusion

Understanding physician CME requirements by state is essential for maintaining compliance, especially for physicians who practice in multiple states or are considering relocation. Requirements vary dramatically—from New York's zero hours to Michigan's 150 hours over three years—and mandatory topic requirements add another layer of complexity.

Use CredentialMate to track your CME hours across multiple states, monitor mandatory topic completion, and receive automated alerts when requirements change—ensuring you maintain compliance in every state where you practice.
