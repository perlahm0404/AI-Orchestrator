# NPDB Reporting: What Gets Reported and Why It Matters

## Introduction

The National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) is often called the "permanent record" of the medical profession. Established by Congress in 1986 and operational since 1990, the NPDB contains information on malpractice payments, adverse licensure actions, and other reportable events for healthcare practitioners across the United States.

For physicians, an NPDB report can have lasting career consequences—affecting hospital privileges, insurance panel participation, employment, and licensing in other states. Understanding what gets reported, who can query the database, and how reports affect your career is essential for every practicing physician.

## What Is the NPDB?

### Overview

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Full Name | National Practitioner Data Bank |
| Established | Health Care Quality Improvement Act of 1986 |
| Operational | September 1, 1990 |
| Administered by | HHS/HRSA |
| Authority | 45 CFR Part 60 |
| Website | npdb.hrsa.gov |

### Purpose

The NPDB was created to:
- Improve healthcare quality
- Restrict ability of incompetent practitioners to move between states
- Encourage professional peer review
- Provide credentialing information to authorized entities

### Key Statistics

| Metric | Approximate Value |
|--------|-------------------|
| Total reports | 1.5+ million |
| Medical practitioners covered | All licensed |
| Entities that can query | 20,000+ |
| Reports added annually | ~100,000 |

## What Gets Reported to the NPDB

### Category 1: Medical Malpractice Payments

**Any payment made on behalf of a physician in settlement or judgment of a malpractice claim must be reported.**

| Reported | Not Reported |
|----------|--------------|
| Settlement payments | Defense costs only |
| Jury verdicts | Dismissed cases (no payment) |
| Arbitration awards | Defense verdicts |
| Any payment amount | Payments by physician personally |

**Reporting Entity**: Insurance company or self-insured entity

**Threshold**: $0—any payment, regardless of amount, is reportable

**Important**: The report indicates a payment was made, not that malpractice occurred. Many cases settle for business reasons regardless of merit.

### Category 2: Adverse Licensure Actions

**Actions taken by state medical boards against a physician's license.**

| Reportable Actions | Examples |
|-------------------|----------|
| Revocation | License permanently canceled |
| Suspension | License temporarily inactive |
| Probation | Supervised practice period |
| Reprimand | Formal censure |
| Limitation | Practice restrictions |
| Surrender | Voluntary giving up license (in lieu of action) |
| Censure | Official criticism |

**Reporting Entity**: State medical boards

**Timeframe**: Within 30 days of action

### Category 3: Adverse Clinical Privilege Actions

**Actions taken by hospitals and healthcare entities regarding clinical privileges.**

| Reportable Actions | Details |
|-------------------|---------|
| Denial of privileges | For competency/conduct reasons |
| Reduction of privileges | Limiting scope |
| Suspension of privileges | Temporary removal |
| Revocation of privileges | Permanent removal |
| Non-renewal | When due to competency/conduct |
| Resignation during investigation | When to avoid action |

**Reporting Entity**: Hospitals, HMOs, professional societies

**Duration Threshold**: Actions lasting more than 30 days

**Key Point**: A physician who resigns from a hospital while under investigation (or within 60 days of investigation) triggers a report.

### Category 4: Professional Society Actions

**Adverse membership actions by professional societies.**

| Reportable | Not Reportable |
|------------|----------------|
| Membership denial for competency | Denial for dues non-payment |
| Membership revocation for conduct | Voluntary non-renewal |
| Membership suspension | Administrative termination |

### Category 5: Medicare/Medicaid Exclusions

**Exclusions from federal healthcare programs.**

| Reportable | Authority |
|------------|-----------|
| OIG exclusion | HHS Office of Inspector General |
| State Medicaid exclusion | State agencies |
| GSA debarment | Government-wide |

### Category 6: DEA Actions

**Adverse actions related to controlled substance authority.**

| Reportable DEA Actions |
|----------------------|
| Registration denial |
| Registration revocation |
| Registration suspension |
| Voluntary surrender (to avoid action) |

## Who Can Query the NPDB

### Authorized Queriers

| Entity Type | Query Authority | Purpose |
|-------------|-----------------|---------|
| Hospitals | Mandatory | Credentialing, privilege decisions |
| State licensing boards | Yes | License applications, investigations |
| Health plans | Yes | Provider enrollment |
| Professional societies | Yes | Membership decisions |
| Healthcare employers | Yes (some) | Employment decisions |
| DEA | Yes | Registration decisions |
| Individual practitioners | Yes | Self-query |

### Who Cannot Query

| Entity | Access |
|--------|--------|
| General public | No direct access |
| Attorneys (generally) | No (except through legal process) |
| Patients | No direct access |
| Media | No |

### Self-Query

Physicians can query their own NPDB record:

- **Cost**: ~$4 per query
- **Website**: npdb.hrsa.gov
- **Recommended frequency**: Annually or before major credentialing

## How NPDB Reports Affect Physicians

### Hospital Credentialing

**Hospitals must query NPDB**:
- At initial credentialing
- At reappointment (every 2 years typically)
- When joining medical staff

**Impact of reports**:
- Reports don't automatically disqualify
- Hospital must evaluate and document consideration
- Multiple reports raise red flags
- Explanation opportunity usually provided

### State Licensure

**State boards query NPDB**:
- At initial licensure
- At renewal (many states)
- During investigations

**Impact**:
- May trigger additional inquiry
- Must disclose on applications
- Can affect reciprocity/endorsement

### Insurance Panels

**Health plans query NPDB**:
- At initial enrollment
- At re-credentialing
- May have automatic disqualifiers

**Impact**:
- May be denied participation
- May be removed from panel
- Affects patient access

### Employment

**Healthcare employers may query**:
- At hiring
- Periodically during employment

**Impact**:
- May affect hiring decision
- May trigger termination review

## What Does NOT Get Reported

### Common Misconceptions

| Not Reportable | Why |
|----------------|-----|
| Malpractice lawsuit filed | No payment yet |
| Malpractice defense verdict | No payment |
| Dismissed malpractice case | No payment |
| Hospital peer review (no action) | Review alone not reportable |
| CME non-compliance (no discipline) | Renewal delay not reportable |
| Complaint to board (no action) | Complaint alone not reportable |
| Informal board guidance | Not formal action |

### The Payment Threshold

There is **no minimum dollar threshold** for malpractice payment reporting:
- $1 payment = reported
- $1,000,000 payment = reported
- Defense costs without settlement = not reported

## Disputing NPDB Reports

### Grounds for Dispute

| Valid Dispute Grounds | Invalid Dispute Grounds |
|-----------------------|------------------------|
| Factual errors (wrong person, date, etc.) | Disagreement with action taken |
| Reporting entity error | Belief action was unfair |
| Incorrect classification | Payment amount disputes |
| Identity theft | Defense of underlying case |

### Dispute Process

1. **Obtain your report**: Self-query to see exact content
2. **Identify specific errors**: Document factual inaccuracies
3. **Contact reporting entity**: Request correction at source
4. **File formal dispute**: Through NPDB if entity doesn't correct
5. **Secretary review**: HHS may review disputed reports

### Adding a Statement

Physicians can add a **Subject Statement** to their NPDB report:
- Up to 4,000 characters
- Provides context
- Viewed alongside report
- Cannot dispute underlying facts

## Reporting Timeline

### When Reports Must Be Filed

| Report Type | Deadline |
|-------------|----------|
| Malpractice payments | Within 30 days of payment |
| State board actions | Within 30 days of action |
| Hospital privilege actions | Within 30 days (if >30 days duration) |
| Medicare/Medicaid exclusions | Per federal requirements |

### Duration in Database

**NPDB reports are permanent**:
- Reports are never automatically removed
- Even after license restoration, original action remains
- Context can be added, but report persists

## Strategies for Physicians

### Prevention

1. **Practice good medicine**: Follow standards of care
2. **Document thoroughly**: Protect against claims
3. **Communicate with patients**: Reduce complaint risk
4. **Maintain CME compliance**: Avoid board actions
5. **Stay current**: Follow regulatory changes

### If a Report Occurs

1. **Self-query**: Know exactly what's reported
2. **Document context**: Prepare explanation for credentialing
3. **Add statement**: Provide your perspective
4. **Dispute errors**: Challenge inaccuracies only
5. **Consult attorney**: For significant actions

### During Credentialing

When asked about NPDB reports:
- Be truthful and complete
- Provide context
- Show rehabilitation/improvement
- Demonstrate current competency

## Key Takeaways

- **NPDB reports are permanent**—they never automatically expire or disappear
- **Malpractice payments of any amount** are reported (no minimum threshold)
- **State board disciplinary actions** are reported within 30 days
- **Hospital privilege actions lasting >30 days** are reportable
- **Resigning during investigation** triggers a report
- **Hospitals must query NPDB** for credentialing—it's mandatory
- **Self-query annually** to know your record
- **Reports don't automatically disqualify**—but they require explanation

## Conclusion

The NPDB creates accountability in the healthcare system, but it also means that certain career events follow physicians permanently. Understanding what triggers reports—and what doesn't—helps physicians navigate their careers while avoiding reportable situations where possible.

Use CredentialMate to track your license status, monitor for potential issues, and maintain documentation that supports your professional standing. Regular self-queries of the NPDB ensure you know your record before credentialing bodies do.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long do NPDB reports stay on record?

NPDB reports are permanent. They remain in the database indefinitely and are never automatically removed. Even after license restoration following suspension, the original action remains on record.

### Do all malpractice settlements get reported?

Yes. Any payment made on behalf of a physician to settle or resolve a malpractice claim must be reported to the NPDB. There is no minimum dollar threshold—even a $1 payment is reportable.

### Can I see my own NPDB record?

Yes. Physicians can self-query the NPDB through npdb.hrsa.gov for approximately $4. Self-querying annually is recommended to ensure you know what's in your record before credentialing bodies query it.

### Will a complaint to the medical board be reported?

No, not automatically. Only formal disciplinary actions (reprimand, suspension, revocation, etc.) are reported. A complaint that doesn't result in formal action is not reportable.

### Can I dispute an NPDB report?

You can dispute factual errors (wrong person, incorrect date, misclassification). You cannot dispute the underlying action itself through NPDB—that must be addressed with the reporting entity (medical board, hospital, etc.). You can add a Subject Statement providing context.
