# Michigan Medical License Renewal: Fees and Requirements 2026

## Introduction

Michigan physicians maintain their medical licenses through the Michigan Board of Medicine, which operates under the Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs (LARA). With a triennial (3-year) renewal cycle and 150 CME hours required per cycle, Michigan has one of the higher CME requirements when annualized.

**Critical Update 2026**: Michigan is withdrawing from the Interstate Medical Licensure Compact (IMLC) effective **March 28, 2026**. This affects physicians using the compact for Michigan licensure.

This guide covers everything Michigan physicians need to know about medical license renewal in 2026, including current fees, CME requirements, and the IMLC withdrawal implications.
