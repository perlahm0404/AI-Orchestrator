# FSMB Disciplinary Database: What Physicians Should Know

## Introduction

The Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB) maintains multiple databases that track physician credentials, disciplinary actions, and licensing information across all U.S. states and territories. For physicians, understanding these systems—and what information they contain—is essential for career management, license applications, and professional reputation.

Whether you're applying for a new state license, undergoing hospital credentialing, or simply want to know what's in your professional record, this guide explains FSMB's data systems and how they affect practicing physicians.

## What Is the FSMB?

### Overview

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Full Name | Federation of State Medical Boards |
| Established | 1912 |
| Headquarters | Euless, Texas |
| Members | 70+ state medical boards (all 50 states + DC + territories) |
| Website | fsmb.org |

### FSMB's Role

The FSMB serves as the umbrella organization for all U.S. state medical boards. It:

- Facilitates information sharing between boards
- Maintains credential verification systems (FCVS)
- Provides disciplinary action databases
- Operates the IMLC (Interstate Medical Licensure Compact)
- Publishes policy recommendations
- Offers examination services (USMLE partnership)

## FSMB Data Systems

### Key Databases and Services

| System | Purpose | Who Can Access |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| FCVS (Credentials Verification) | Primary source verification | Boards, hospitals, physicians |
| DocInfo | Public physician lookup | General public |
| Board Action Data Bank | Disciplinary action tracking | Member boards |
| IMLC Database | Compact licensing records | Participating states |

### Federation Credentials Verification Service (FCVS)

**What it contains**:
- Medical education verification
- Examination history (USMLE scores)
- Postgraduate training records
- License history (all states)
- Board certification status
- Disciplinary actions from all jurisdictions

**Who uses it**:
- State medical boards (licensing)
- Hospitals (credentialing)
- Insurance companies (panel enrollment)
- Healthcare employers (verification)

**Cost**: Varies by state; typically $375-$500 for initial profile

### DocInfo.org

**The public-facing physician lookup tool.**

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| URL | docinfo.org |
| Cost | Free |
| Access | Public |
| Information | License status, disciplinary actions, education |

**What DocInfo Shows**:
- Active license information
- Board actions (suspensions, revocations, etc.)
- Education and training verification
- Specialty board certification
- Practice location (if available)

**What DocInfo Does NOT Show**:
- Malpractice payment history (NPDB only)
- Pending investigations
- Confidential board agreements
- Detailed disciplinary documents

## What Gets Reported to FSMB

### Reportable Actions

State medical boards report to FSMB:

| Action Type | Examples |
|-------------|----------|
| License denial | Application rejected |
| License revocation | Permanent loss |
| License suspension | Temporary loss |
| Probation | Supervised practice |
| Reprimand/Censure | Formal discipline |
| Practice limitations | Scope restrictions |
| Surrender | Voluntary (to avoid action) |
| Fines | Monetary penalties |

### Reporting Timeline

| Event | Typical Reporting |
|-------|-------------------|
| Final board order | Within 30 days |
| License status change | Within 10 days |
| Reinstatement | When effective |

### Interstate Reporting

**Key point**: Actions in one state are reported to FSMB and visible to all other states.

This means:
- Applying for a new state license will reveal prior discipline
- Hospital credentialing will show disciplinary history
- Insurance enrollment will access this information
- The action follows you permanently

## How FSMB Data Affects Physicians

### New State License Applications

When applying for a license in a new state:

1. State board queries FCVS/FSMB
2. All prior licensure history appears
3. Any disciplinary actions are flagged
4. Applicant must explain and document
5. Board evaluates in context

**Impact of prior discipline**:
- Not automatic disqualification (usually)
- Requires full disclosure
- May require additional documentation
- Could result in denial or conditions

### Hospital Credentialing

Hospitals must:
- Query NPDB (malpractice, privileges)
- Verify license via state boards
- Often use FCVS for efficiency

**FSMB data provides**:
- Comprehensive license history
- All jurisdictions in one query
- Primary source verification
- Disciplinary action details

### Insurance Panel Enrollment

Health plans check:
- Current license status
- Disciplinary history
- Board certification
- Malpractice history (NPDB)

### Employment Decisions

Healthcare employers may verify credentials through:
- Direct state board queries
- FCVS profile access
- DocInfo (public record)

## FSMB vs. NPDB: Understanding the Difference

### Comparison Table

| Aspect | FSMB | NPDB |
|--------|------|------|
| Administered by | Federation of State Medical Boards | HHS/HRSA |
| Primary focus | License/discipline | Malpractice/privileges |
| Malpractice payments | No | Yes |
| Hospital privilege actions | Limited | Yes |
| License actions | Yes | Yes |
| Public access | DocInfo (limited) | No |
| Self-query | FCVS profile | Yes ($4) |

### What Each System Captures

**FSMB/FCVS**:
- All state license history
- Board disciplinary actions
- Education verification
- Examination history
- Training verification

**NPDB**:
- Malpractice payments (any amount)
- Hospital privilege actions
- DEA actions
- Medicare/Medicaid exclusions
- Professional society actions

### Overlap

Both systems capture:
- State medical board disciplinary actions
- DEA enforcement actions
- Federal program exclusions

## Checking Your Own Records

### FCVS Profile

To access your FCVS profile:

1. **Create account**: fcvs.fsmb.org
2. **Request profile**: Submit documentation
3. **Pay fee**: Approximately $375-$500
4. **Review contents**: Verify accuracy
5. **Update as needed**: Add new credentials

**Benefits**:
- Streamlines multi-state licensing
- Pre-verified credentials
- Expedites hospital credentialing
- Single source of truth

### DocInfo Lookup

To see your public record:

1. **Visit**: docinfo.org
2. **Search**: By name or license number
3. **Review**: Public information displayed
4. **Note**: This is what others see

### State Board Records

Contact each state where you hold/held a license:
- Request copy of license file
- Verify no pending actions
- Confirm accurate information

## Disputing FSMB Records

### When to Dispute

| Valid Dispute | Invalid Dispute |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Factual errors | Disagreement with discipline |
| Wrong physician | Belief action was unfair |
| Incorrect dates | Challenging board's authority |
| Missing reinstatement | Procedural complaints |

### Dispute Process

1. **Identify the source**: FSMB gets data from state boards
2. **Contact originating board**: Corrections must come from source
3. **Provide documentation**: Evidence of error
4. **Follow up**: Ensure FSMB records updated
5. **Verify correction**: Check DocInfo and FCVS

**Important**: FSMB cannot change information that originated from a state board. You must correct at the source.

## Strategies for Physicians

### Proactive Monitoring

1. **Annual DocInfo check**: See your public record
2. **FCVS profile maintenance**: Keep credentials current
3. **State board verification**: Confirm accuracy in each state
4. **NPDB self-query**: Complete picture ($4 annually)

### If You Have Disciplinary History

1. **Be truthful**: Nondisclosure is often worse than the original action
2. **Prepare documentation**: Context, rehabilitation, remediation
3. **Show improvement**: CME, monitoring completion, etc.
4. **Consult attorney**: For significant actions
5. **Consider timing**: When rehabilitation is demonstrable

### During New Applications

When applying with prior discipline:

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Disclose fully | Omit or minimize |
| Provide context | Make excuses |
| Show rehabilitation | Blame others |
| Include documentation | Leave gaps |
| Be professional | Be defensive |

## State Board Reporting to FSMB

### All States Report

Every U.S. state medical board reports to FSMB:
- Final disciplinary orders
- License status changes
- Reinstatements
- New licenses issued

### Timeliness

Most boards report within:
- 10-30 days for disciplinary actions
- Immediately for license status changes

### What Boards Share

| Always Reported | Not Always Reported |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Revocations | Pending investigations |
| Suspensions | Informal agreements |
| Probation | Confidential settlements |
| Reprimands | Complaint dismissals |
| Surrenders | Board correspondence |

## The IMLC Connection

### FSMB and the Compact

The FSMB administers the Interstate Medical Licensure Compact (IMLC):

| IMLC Feature | FSMB Role |
|--------------|-----------|
| Application processing | IMLC Commission secretariat |
| Background checks | FBI fingerprint coordination |
| Data sharing | Disciplinary history access |
| Eligibility verification | Credential confirmation |

### IMLC Eligibility and FSMB Records

To qualify for IMLC expedited licensing:
- No disciplinary history that would disqualify

- **Full disclosure** on applications is essential—nondisclosure is often worse
- **FSMB administers IMLC**, connecting disciplinary history to compact eligibility

## Conclusion

The FSMB's data systems create transparency and accountability in physician licensing across the United States. While disciplinary actions can affect career mobility, understanding these systems—and maintaining accurate records—helps physicians navigate licensing and credentialing successfully.

Use CredentialMate to track your licenses across all states, monitor your professional record, and receive alerts about renewal deadlines and potential issues before they affect your practice.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can the public see my disciplinary history?

Yes, through DocInfo.org. Final disciplinary actions (suspensions, revocations, probations, reprimands) from state medical boards are publicly accessible. However, DocInfo does not show malpractice payments, pending investigations, or confidential agreements.

### How do I correct an error in FSMB records?

FSMB records come from state medical boards. To correct an error, contact the originating state board with documentation. Once corrected at the source, the FSMB record will be updated. FSMB cannot independently change information reported by boards.

### Does FSMB share information with NPDB?

FSMB and NPDB are separate systems. State medical boards report directly to both systems, but FSMB and NPDB don't directly share data. You should monitor both: FCVS/DocInfo for FSMB data, and NPDB self-query for malpractice/privilege actions.

### Will discipline in one state prevent licensing in another?

Not automatically, but it will be disclosed to any state where you apply. Each state board evaluates the nature of the discipline, time elapsed, rehabilitation demonstrated, and current fitness to practice. Many physicians successfully obtain licenses despite prior discipline.

### How long do disciplinary records stay in FSMB databases?

Disciplinary records are permanent. Unlike criminal records in some jurisdictions, medical board disciplinary actions do not expire or automatically seal. Context and rehabilitation can be added, but the underlying record remains.
