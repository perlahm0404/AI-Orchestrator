# Mandatory CME Topics by State: Physician Requirements 2026

## Introduction

Completing your state's required CME hours isn't enough if you miss mandatory topics. Many states require physicians to complete specific education on topics like opioid prescribing, medical ethics, child abuse recognition, or cultural competency—in addition to total hour requirements. Missing these mandatory topics can result in renewal denial, even if your total hours exceed the minimum.

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of mandatory CME topics by state for 2026, helping physicians ensure complete compliance.

## Understanding Mandatory vs. General CME

### The Difference

| Type | Definition |
|------|------------|
| General CME | Any AMA PRA Category 1 credit meeting total hour requirement |
| Mandatory Topic CME | Specific subjects required by state law/regulation |

### Why Mandatory Topics Matter

- **Required for renewal**—cannot substitute general CME
- **Specific content**—must address designated subject matter
- **Documented separately**—tracked independently from total hours
- **Often have their own hour requirements**—not just any amount

## Tracking Mandatory Topics

### Best Practices

1. **Identify your state's requirements** at start of renewal cycle
2. **Track separately** from general CME hours
3. **Document specifically** with topic-specific certificates
4. **Complete early** in the cycle
5. **Verify approved providers** for mandatory topics

### Documentation Requirements

| Element | Why It Matters |
|---------|----------------|
| Topic title | Must match state requirement |
| Hours credited | Must meet minimum |
| Provider approval | May need state-approved provider |
| Completion date | Within renewal period |

## Finding Approved Mandatory Topic CME

### State-Approved Providers

Some states require mandatory topics from specific approved providers:

| State | Approval Requirement |
|-------|---------------------|
| Florida | Board-approved courses for mandatory topics |
| Pennsylvania | Approved child abuse training |
| Washington | Approved suicide prevention programs |

### Common Resources

| Resource | Topics Offered |
|----------|---------------|
| State medical societies | Often offer all mandatory topics |
| Hospital systems | Internal mandatory topic programs |
| Medscape | Many mandatory topics available free |
| AAFP | Ethics, pain management, others |
| Specialty boards | May include mandatory topics in MOC |

## Multi-State Practice Considerations

### When You Hold Multiple Licenses

| Strategy | Approach |
|----------|----------|
| Identify all requirements | List mandatory topics for each state |
| Find overlap | One course may count for multiple states |
| Track separately | Document compliance for each license |
| Complete comprehensive topics | Cover broadest requirements |

### Example: Multi-State Mandatory Topics

**Physician licensed in FL, TX, and PA**:

| Topic | FL | TX | PA |
|-------|-----|-----|-----|
| Medical Errors | 2 hrs | - | - |
| HIV/AIDS | 1 hr | - | - |
| Laws/Rules | 2 hrs | - | - |
| Opioid Prescribing | 2 hrs | Yes | Yes |
| Ethics | - | 2 hrs | - |
| Child Abuse | - | - | 2 hrs |

**Total unique mandatory**: 11+ hours across three states

## Consequences of Missing Mandatory Topics

### What Happens

| Scenario | Consequence |
|----------|-------------|
| Missing mandatory topic at renewal | Renewal denied |
| False attestation | Disciplinary action |
| Repeated non-compliance | Increased scrutiny, penalties |

### Remediation

Most states allow completion of missing mandatory topics within a grace period:
1. Board identifies deficiency
2. Deadline given to complete
3. Submit proof of completion
4. Renewal processed

## Key Takeaways

- **Mandatory topics are separate** from total CME hours
- **Florida has the most extensive** mandatory topic requirements
- **Opioid prescribing CME** is required in most states for prescribers
- **Track mandatory topics separately** throughout your renewal cycle
- **Complete mandatory topics early** to avoid renewal delays
- **Multi-state physicians** must meet each state's unique requirements
- **Verify provider approval** for mandatory topic CME

## Conclusion

Missing mandatory CME topics is one of the most common reasons for license renewal delays. Unlike general CME hours that can be made up with any Category 1 content, mandatory topics require specific education that cannot be substituted. Physicians should identify their state's mandatory requirements at the start of each renewal cycle and complete them early.

Use CredentialMate to track both your total CME hours and mandatory topic completion, ensuring you're always compliant with your state's specific requirements.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do mandatory CME hours count toward my total requirement?

Yes, in most states mandatory topic hours are included in (not in addition to) your total CME requirement. For example, Florida requires 40 hours total, and the mandatory topics (approximately 10 hours) count toward that 40.

### What if I'm licensed in multiple states with different mandatory topics?

You must meet the mandatory requirements for each state where you're licensed. Look for CME courses that cover multiple state requirements simultaneously to maximize efficiency.

### Can I substitute general CME for mandatory topics?

No. Mandatory topics must be completed as specified—you cannot substitute extra general CME hours for missing mandatory topic requirements.

### How do I know if a CME course meets my state's mandatory topic requirement?

Check with your state medical board for approved providers, or verify that the course specifically addresses the required topic and is AMA PRA Category 1 credited. Some states require courses from specific approved providers.

### What happens if I miss a mandatory topic at renewal?

Most states will deny renewal until the mandatory topic is completed. You'll typically receive notice of the deficiency and a deadline to complete the required CME. Submit proof of completion to process your renewal.
