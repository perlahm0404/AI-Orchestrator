# Inactive Medical License Status: When and How to Use It

## Introduction

Inactive license status offers a middle ground between maintaining an active license and letting it lapse. For physicians taking career breaks, relocating, or transitioning roles, inactive status preserves your license at reduced cost without the complications of reinstatement.

## What Is Inactive Status?

### Definition

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Practice authority | None (cannot practice) |
| License maintained | Yes |
| CME requirement | Often reduced or waived |
| Renewal fee | Typically 50% or less |
| Public record | Shows "inactive" |

### Comparison to Other Statuses

| Status | Practice OK? | Maintained? | Cost |
|--------|-------------|-------------|------|
| Active | Yes | Yes | Full fee |
| Inactive | No | Yes | Reduced |
| Lapsed | No | At risk | None |
| Expired | No | No | N/A |

## When to Consider Inactive Status

### Good Candidates

| Situation | Benefit |
|-----------|---------|
| Parental leave | Maintain license cheaply |
| Medical leave | Preserve without practice |
| Relocation transition | Keep options open |
| Administrative role | No patient care |
| Semi-retirement | Maintain credentials |

### Not Ideal For

| Situation | Better Option |
|-----------|---------------|
| Occasional practice | Keep active |
| Locum potential | Keep active |
| Any patient care | Must be active |

## State Availability

### States Offering Inactive Status

| State | Inactive Fee | Reactivation |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| California | ~$603 (50%) | Full fee + CME |
| Florida | ~$180 (50%) | $100 + renewal |
| Most states | 50% typical | Varies |

### States Without Inactive Option

Some states don't offer formal inactive status—research your specific state.

## How to Request Inactive Status

### Process

1. Log into licensing portal
2. Request status change
3. Acknowledge cannot practice
4. Pay reduced fee (if applicable)
5. Confirm status change

### Timing

Request inactive status:
- Before renewal if planning non-practice
- After renewal if situation changes
- Proactively if anticipating break

## Reactivating from Inactive

### Typical Requirements

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| Application | Request reactivation |
| Fee | Full renewal fee |
| CME | May need catch-up |
| Background check | Sometimes required |

### Timeline

Reactivation typically faster than reinstating a lapsed license.
