# Physician Address Change Notification Requirements by State

## Introduction

When you move or change practice locations, updating your address with state medical boards is a legal requirement—not just a courtesy. Most states mandate notification within a specific timeframe, and failure to comply can result in missed renewal notices, disciplinary issues, and license complications.

## Why Address Updates Matter

### Consequences of Outdated Address

| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| Missed renewal notices | Risk of license lapse |
| Failed audit correspondence | Compliance problems |
| Legal notifications undelivered | Serious consequences |
| Verification inquiries | Credentialing delays |

## State Requirements

### Typical Notification Timeframes

| Timeframe | States |
|-----------|--------|
| 10 days | Arizona |
| 14 days | Some states |
| 30 days | Most common |
| 60 days | Few states |

### What to Update

| Address Type | When to Update |
|--------------|---------------|
| Home/mailing | Always |
| Practice/business | Always |
| Email | If registered |
| Phone | If registered |

## How to Update

### Online Portal

Most states allow online updates:
1. Log into licensing portal
2. Navigate to profile/address section
3. Enter new information
4. Submit change
5. Verify update processed

### Written Notification

Some states require:
- Signed letter
- Official form
- Documentation

## Multi-State Considerations

If licensed in multiple states:
- Update each state separately
- Track notification requirements
- Document all submissions

## Key Takeaways

- **Update within required timeframe** (usually 30 days)
- **Update all licensed states** after any move
- **Verify updates processed** through portal
- **Keep documentation** of notifications
