# Telemedicine Licensing Requirements by State 2026

## Introduction

Telemedicine has transformed healthcare delivery, but the fundamental rule of medical licensure remains: **you must be licensed in the state where your patient is located**. A telemedicine appointment occurs in the patient's state, not the physician's state—meaning physicians providing virtual care across state lines need licenses in multiple jurisdictions.

Post-pandemic, telemedicine utilization has stabilized at significantly higher levels than pre-2020, making multi-state licensure a practical necessity for many physicians. This guide covers telemedicine licensing requirements by state for 2026, including the role of the Interstate Medical Licensure Compact (IMLC), state-specific rules, and strategies for building a compliant multi-state telemedicine practice.

## The Fundamental Rule: Patient Location Determines Jurisdiction

### Where Does a Telemedicine Visit Occur?

| Scenario | Jurisdiction |
|----------|--------------|
| Physician in Texas, patient in California | California |
| Physician in New York, patient in Florida | Florida |
| Physician at home, patient traveling in Nevada | Nevada |

**The patient's physical location at the time of the encounter determines which state's medical practice laws apply.**

### Why This Matters

- You must hold an active license in the patient's state
- You must follow that state's medical practice act
- You must meet that state's CME requirements
- You're subject to that state's disciplinary authority
- Malpractice claims are governed by patient's state laws

## Interstate Medical Licensure Compact (IMLC)

### IMLC for Telemedicine

The IMLC provides the most efficient pathway for physicians to obtain multiple state licenses for telemedicine practice:

| Feature | Benefit for Telemedicine |
|---------|-------------------------|
| Single application | Apply once for multiple states |
| Expedited processing | 2-4 weeks vs. 3-6 months traditional |
| 42 states + DC + Guam | Covers ~80% of U.S. population |
| Cost efficient | One application fee + individual state fees |

### IMLC Coverage (2026)

**Participating states**: 42 + DC + Guam
**Notable non-participants**: California, New York, Oregon
**Upcoming change**: Michigan withdrawing March 28, 2026

### IMLC Limitations for Telemedicine

| Limitation | Impact |
|------------|--------|
| Not a single license | Still separate state licenses to maintain |
| No California | Must apply directly to MBC |
| No New York | Must apply directly to NYSED |
| CME varies by state | Must meet each state's requirements |
| Renewal by state | Each state has own renewal schedule |

## State-by-State Telemedicine Requirements

### States with Telemedicine-Specific Rules

| State | Key Requirements |
|-------|-----------------|
| Texas | Full license required; limited telemedicine-specific rules |
| Florida | Full license required; must comply with FAC 64B8 |
| California | Full license required; informed consent rules apply |
| New York | Full license required; prescribing restrictions |
| Georgia | Full license required since 2020 |

### States with Special Telemedicine Provisions

Some states have enacted telemedicine-specific provisions:

**California**
- Full license required for ongoing telemedicine
- Business and Professions Code applies to telehealth
- Specific consent requirements for telemedicine
- No out-of-state exemptions for regular practice

**Texas**
- Full license required
- Texas Medical Board Rule 174 governs telemedicine
- Prescribing via telemedicine requires examination standards
- No special telemedicine-only license

**Florida**
- Full license required
- Florida Statutes Chapter 456.47 governs telehealth
- Must register with DOH if using telehealth
- Standard of care same as in-person

### Prescribing via Telemedicine

Prescribing controlled substances via telemedicine has additional requirements:

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| DEA registration | In state where patient located (for controlled substances) |
| Valid prescription | Must meet state prescribing rules |
| Ryan Haight Act | Federal law governing online controlled substance prescribing |
| PDMP check | Required in most states |

## Building a Multi-State Telemedicine Practice

### Step 1: Identify Target States

Determine which states you need based on:
- Current patient locations
- Planned service expansion
- Employer requirements
- Market analysis

### Step 2: Categorize by Licensing Pathway

| Category | States | Pathway |
|----------|--------|---------|
| IMLC available | 42 states | Single IMLC application |
| Direct application | CA, NY, OR | Individual state applications |
| Post-Michigan | MI (after 3/28/26) | Direct to LARA |

### Step 3: Apply Strategically

**Recommended sequence**:
1. Apply through IMLC for all participating states needed
2. Apply directly to California if needed
3. Apply directly to New York if needed
4. Apply to other non-IMLC states as needed

### Step 4: Maintain Compliance

For each state license:
- Track expiration date
- Meet CME requirements (varies by state)
- Maintain required documentation
- Monitor regulatory changes

## Telemedicine Licensing Strategies

### Strategy 1: IMLC Maximization

**Approach**: Obtain licenses in all IMLC states where you might have patients

**Pros**:
- Maximum flexibility
- Single application process
- Ready for patient growth in new markets

**Cons**:
- Higher upfront cost
- More licenses to maintain
- CME compliance complexity

### Strategy 2: Targeted Licensing

**Approach**: License only in states with current/planned patient volume

**Pros**:
- Lower cost
- Fewer licenses to track
- Simpler compliance

**Cons**:
- Must turn away patients from unlicensed states
- Delays if new states needed urgently

### Strategy 3: Regional Focus

**Approach**: License in a geographic region (e.g., all Southeast states)

**Pros**:
- Manageable scope
- Time zone alignment
- Regional market focus

**Cons**:
- Limited growth potential
- May miss opportunities

## CME Requirements for Multi-State Practice

### Challenge: Varying Requirements

| State | Hours | Cycle | Mandatory Topics |
|-------|-------|-------|------------------|
| California | 50 | 2 years | None |
| Texas | 24 | 2 years | Ethics, pain mgmt, trafficking |
| Florida | 40 | 2 years | HIV, errors, DV, trafficking |
| New York | 0 | 3 years | None |
| Pennsylvania | 100 | 2 years | Child abuse |

### Solution: Meet Most Restrictive

1. **Identify highest requirement** (e.g., Pennsylvania at 100 hours)
2. **Complete all mandatory topics** across all states
3. **Track by state** to ensure each state's specific requirements met
4. **Overlap strategically** (ethics courses count in multiple states)

## Special Considerations

### Medicare Telemedicine

Medicare has specific telemedicine rules:

- Must be enrolled in Medicare in state where patient located
- Originating site requirements (though relaxed post-COVID)
- Specific CPT codes for telehealth
- Geographic restrictions (though many waived temporarily)

### Malpractice Insurance

Ensure your policy covers:
- All states where you practice telemedicine
- Virtual care specifically mentioned
- Multi-state practice endorsement if needed

### Medical Records

Requirements for telemedicine documentation:
- Patient's location at time of encounter
- Informed consent for telemedicine
- Compliance with each state's medical records laws
- HIPAA compliance across all jurisdictions

## States Without Full Telemedicine Licensure Requirements

### Consultation Exceptions

Some states allow out-of-state consultations without licensure under limited circumstances:

| Exception Type | Typical Requirements |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Consultation with in-state physician | Licensed in-state physician involved in care |
| Emergency/disaster | Temporary, emergency circumstances |
| Infrequent practice | Very limited number of patients |

**Warning**: These exceptions are narrow. Regular telemedicine practice requires full licensure in virtually all states.

### Verification Required

Before relying on any exception:
1. Verify current state law (changes frequently)
2. Confirm your situation qualifies
3. Document compliance
4. Consult healthcare attorney if uncertain

## Key Takeaways

- **Patient location determines jurisdiction**—you need a license where your patient is located
- **IMLC covers 42 states** through a single application (but not CA, NY, OR)
- **California and New York require direct applications**—not in IMLC
- **Michigan withdrawing from IMLC** March 28, 2026
- **CME requirements vary dramatically**—track separately for each state
- **Prescribing controlled substances** has additional DEA and state requirements
- **No single multi-state telemedicine license exists**—you need individual state licenses

## Conclusion

Telemedicine licensing in 2026 remains state-based, with the fundamental rule unchanged: practice occurs where the patient is located. The IMLC has significantly simplified multi-state licensing for the 42 participating states, but physicians serving California, New York, and Oregon patients must still navigate direct application processes.

Building a compliant multi-state telemedicine practice requires careful planning, ongoing license maintenance, and attention to varying CME requirements. Use CredentialMate to track your telemedicine licenses across all states, monitor CME compliance for each jurisdiction, and receive alerts about regulatory changes—ensuring your virtual practice remains fully compliant.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need a license in every state where I have telemedicine patients?

Yes. Medical practice occurs in the state where the patient is located at the time of the encounter. You must hold an active license in each state where you provide telemedicine services.

### Can I use the IMLC for telemedicine licensing?

Yes, the IMLC is an excellent tool for telemedicine licensing. It provides expedited access to 42 states through a single application. However, California, New York, and Oregon don't participate, so you'll need direct applications for those states.

### What happens if I provide telemedicine to a patient in a state where I'm not licensed?

This constitutes unlicensed practice of medicine—a criminal offense in most states. You may face prosecution, disciplinary action, malpractice liability, and loss of licenses in other states. Always verify patient location before providing care.

### Do telemedicine visits require different documentation than in-person visits?

Yes. In addition to standard medical record requirements, telemedicine documentation should include the patient's physical location at time of encounter, verification of patient identity, informed consent for telemedicine (if required by state), and notation that care was provided via telemedicine.

### Can I prescribe controlled substances via telemedicine?

Yes, but with significant restrictions. The Ryan Haight Act requires valid prescriber-patient relationships. Many states require initial in-person examinations before prescribing controlled substances. You may need DEA registration in the patient's state for controlled substance prescriptions.
