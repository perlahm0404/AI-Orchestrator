## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why does North Carolina require annual renewal instead of biennial?

North Carolina chose an annual renewal cycle to maintain more frequent contact with licensees and ensure current information. While this requires yearly attention, it allows the board to stay current with physician practice information and compliance status.

### How does the 3-year CME cycle work with annual renewal?

You must maintain 60 CME hours over any rolling 3-year period. At each annual renewal, the board looks back 3 years to verify compliance. Complete approximately 20 hours per year to stay on track consistently.

### What is the North Carolina medical license renewal fee?

The annual renewal fee is approximately $325. Because North Carolina renews annually rather than biennially, the annual outlay is higher than states that spread fees over two years, but the per-year cost is similar to many states.

### Does North Carolina participate in the IMLC?

Yes. North Carolina is a full participating member of the Interstate Medical Licensure Compact. Physicians can use North Carolina as their state of principal license or obtain a North Carolina license through the compact's expedited process.

### What happens if I don't renew my North Carolina license on time?

Practicing with an expired license violates N.C. Gen. Stat. § 90-18 and is a criminal offense. Late renewal incurs penalty fees, and extended lapses require formal reinstatement with additional requirements and fees.
