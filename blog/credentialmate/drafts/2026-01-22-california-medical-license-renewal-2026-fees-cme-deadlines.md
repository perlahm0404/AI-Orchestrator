# California Medical License Renewal 2026: Fees, CME, and Deadlines

## Introduction

California physicians must renew their medical license biennially through the Medical Board of California (MBC). With over 140,000 licensed physicians in the state, understanding the exact renewal requirements, fees, and deadlines is essential to maintaining an active practice.

Practicing medicine with an expired license in California is not just a regulatory violation—it's illegal under Business and Professions Code Section 2052, potentially resulting in disciplinary action, civil liability, and even criminal charges. This comprehensive guide covers everything you need to know about California medical license renewal in 2026, including current fees, CME requirements, and the consequences of missing your deadline.

## California Medical License Renewal Fees (as of January 2026)

The Medical Board of California sets renewal fees according to Business and Professions Code Section 2435. Here's the complete fee breakdown for 2026:

| Fee Type | Amount | Authority |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Biennial Renewal (Active License) | $1,206 | B&P Code Section 2435 |
| Steven M. Thompson Physician Corps Loan Repayment Program | $25 (included) | Mandatory statutory fee |
| CURES (Controlled Substance Utilization Review and Evaluation System) | $30 (included) | Mandatory statutory fee |
| Delinquency Fee (0-30 days late) | +$120.60 (10%) | CCR Section 1365 |
| Delinquency Fee (90+ days late) | +$603 (50%) | CCR Section 1365 |

### Understanding the Fee Structure

The $1,206 biennial renewal fee includes two mandatory statutory fees that support state healthcare programs:

1. **Steven M. Thompson Physician Corps Loan Repayment Program ($25)**: This fund supports loan repayment for physicians who commit to practicing in underserved areas of California.

2. **CURES Fee ($30)**: This supports the Controlled Substance Utilization Review and Evaluation System, California's prescription drug monitoring program that helps identify controlled substance abuse and diversion.

### Delinquency Penalties

California imposes significant penalties for late renewals:

- **0-30 days late**: 10% of the renewal fee ($120.60)
- **90+ days late**: 50% of the renewal fee ($603)

These penalties are in addition to the standard renewal fee and are mandated by California Code of Regulations Section 1365.

## CME Requirements for California Physicians

California requires physicians to complete continuing medical education (CME) as a condition of license renewal. The requirements are established under California Code of Regulations, Title 16, Division 13.8, Article 10.

### Basic CME Requirements

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| Total Hours | 50 hours per biennial renewal period |
| Credit Type | AMA PRA Category 1 or equivalent |
| Reporting | Self-certification at renewal |
| Documentation Retention | 4 years minimum |

### Important CME Compliance Notes

Under CCR Section 1338, it constitutes **unprofessional conduct** for any physician to:

- Misrepresent compliance with CME requirements
- Fail to provide verification upon Board request
- Falsely certify CME completion during renewal

When you renew your license, you declare under penalty of perjury that you have completed the required CME hours. If the Board requests verification and you cannot provide it, you may face disciplinary action including:

- Formal investigation
- Public reprimand
- Administrative penalties
- License suspension or revocation
- Reporting to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB)

### Accepted CME Providers

California accepts CME credits from:

- ACCME-accredited providers
- AMA PRA Category 1 credit activities
- California Medical Association approved programs
- Specialty board maintenance of certification (MOC) activities

### CME Documentation Requirements

Maintain records of your CME activities for at least four years, including:

- Physician's name
- Course or activity title
- Dates of attendance or completion
- Number of credit hours received
- Sponsoring or accrediting organization

## California Has No Grace Period

**Critical Warning**: California provides **no grace period** for license renewal.

Your license expires at 11:59 PM on the expiration date printed on your license. At 12:00 AM the following day, you are no longer authorized to practice medicine in California.

This is different from many other states that offer 30, 60, or even 90-day grace periods. In California, if your license expires on June 30, you cannot see patients on July 1 unless you have successfully renewed.

### States with No Grace Period

California joins a small group of states with no grace period:

- California
- Maryland
- Several others

If you practice in multiple states, verify each state's grace period policy to avoid unintentional violations.

## Consequences of Practicing with an Expired License

Practicing medicine with an expired license in California carries serious consequences under Business and Professions Code Section 2052:

### Legal Consequences

| Type | Potential Outcome |
|------|-------------------|
| Criminal | Misdemeanor charges, potential jail time |
| Civil | Malpractice liability exposure, uninsured practice |
| Professional | Disciplinary action, license revocation |
| Reporting | NPDB adverse action report |

### Professional Impact

- **NPDB Reporting**: Disciplinary actions are reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank under 45 CFR Part 60, creating a permanent record that follows you throughout your career.

- **Hospital Privileges**: Most hospitals require current licensure as a condition of privileges. An expired license may result in immediate suspension of privileges.

- **Insurance Coverage**: Malpractice insurance policies typically require active licensure. Care provided with an expired license may not be covered.

- **Employment**: Medical groups and healthcare systems conduct regular license verification. An expired license can result in termination.

## How to Renew Your California Medical License

### Online Renewal Process

The Medical Board of California uses the BreEZe online licensing system for renewals:

1. **Access BreEZe**: Visit [mbc.ca.gov/breeze](https://mbc.ca.gov/breeze/)
2. **Log In**: Use your existing account or create one
3. **Complete Application**: Answer all required questions
4. **Certify CME Compliance**: Declare completion of 50 CME hours
5. **Pay Fee**: Submit $1,206 via credit card or electronic check
6. **Print Confirmation**: Save your receipt and confirmation number

### Renewal Timeline Recommendations

| Timeframe | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| 90 days before expiration | Receive renewal notice from MBC |
| 60 days before | Verify CME completion, gather documentation |
| 30 days before | Submit renewal application |
| Expiration date | Deadline—no grace period |

### What If You Miss the Deadline?

If your license has already expired:

1. **Stop practicing immediately**—do not see patients
2. **Submit renewal application** with delinquency fee
3. **Pay all required fees** (renewal + delinquency)
4. **Wait for processing**—do not resume practice until license is active

For licenses expired more than 5 years, you may need to apply for a new license and meet current licensure requirements.

## Key Takeaways

- **Biennial renewal fee is $1,206** (includes mandatory program fees)
- **50 hours of Category 1 CME required** per two-year renewal period
- **California has NO grace period**—license expires at midnight on expiration date
- **Late renewal penalties**: 10% (0-30 days) or 50% (90+ days) additional
- **Maintain CME documentation** for at least 4 years
- **Practicing with expired license** is illegal and can result in criminal charges

## Conclusion

California medical license renewal requires careful planning due to the state's strict policies, including no grace period and significant delinquency penalties. With a $1,206 biennial fee and 50 CME hours required, physicians should begin the renewal process well before their expiration date.
