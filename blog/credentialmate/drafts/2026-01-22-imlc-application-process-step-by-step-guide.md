# IMLC Application Process: Step-by-Step Guide for Physicians

## Introduction

The Interstate Medical Licensure Compact (IMLC) offers a faster path to multi-state licensure, but the application process differs from traditional state-by-state applications. Understanding each step—from eligibility verification to license issuance—helps physicians navigate the system efficiently and avoid common pitfalls.

This guide walks through the complete IMLC application process for 2026, including costs, timelines, and what to expect at each stage.

## Before You Apply: Eligibility Check

### IMLC Eligibility Requirements

You must meet ALL of these criteria:

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| State of Principal License (SPL) | Active, unrestricted license in a compact state |
| Board Certification | ABMS or AOA specialty board certified |
| Examination | Passed USMLE, COMLEX, or equivalent |
| Training | Completed GME requirements |
| No Discipline | No history of revocation, suspension, or other discipline |
| No Controlled Substance Issues | No DEA actions |
| No Criminal History | No felony convictions affecting practice |
| No Medicare/Medicaid Exclusions | Never excluded from federal programs |

### Disqualifying Factors

You cannot use IMLC if you have:
- Any license revoked, suspended, or surrendered
- Probation or conditions on any license
- Pending investigations
- History of controlled substance discipline
- Criminal conviction affecting medical practice

## Step 1: Verify Your SPL State

### What Is the State of Principal License?

Your SPL is where you:
- Practice the majority of medicine, OR
- Have your primary residence (if retired/administrative)

### SPL Requirements

| Criteria | Requirement |
|----------|-------------|
| License status | Active and unrestricted |
| IMLC membership | State must be in the Compact |
| Good standing | No pending actions |

### Current IMLC Member States (2026)

42 states + DC + Guam participate. Notable exceptions:
- California
- New York
- Florida (partial, pending)

**Critical Update**: Michigan withdraws March 28, 2026.

## Step 2: Create IMLC Account

### Register at imlcc.org

1. **Visit**: imlcc.org
2. **Create account**: Email and password
3. **Verify email**: Confirm registration
4. **Complete profile**: Personal information

### Information Needed

| Information | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| Legal name | As on medical license |
| Date of birth | For identification |
| SSN | For background check |
| Medical school | Name and graduation year |
| NPI | National Provider Identifier |
| DEA | If registered |
| ECFMG | If applicable |

## Step 3: Initiate Application

### Start Your Application

1. **Log into IMLC portal**
2. **Select "New Application"**
3. **Choose SPL state**: Where your principal license is
4. **Select target states**: States where you want licenses

### Selecting Target States

| Consideration | Guidance |
|---------------|----------|
| Current needs | States where you'll practice now |
| Future needs | States you may practice soon |
| Cost | Each state has separate fee |
| Timing | All process simultaneously |

## Step 4: Pay IMLC Application Fee

### Fee Structure

| Fee Type | Amount | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| IMLC Commission fee | ~$700 | One-time application fee |
| State fees | Varies | Each target state has own fee |
| Background check | Included | FBI fingerprint |

### Example Cost Calculation

**Applying for 3 state licenses through IMLC**:

| Component | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| IMLC application fee | $700 |
| State A license fee | $300 |
| State B license fee | $400 |
| State C license fee | $350 |
| **Total** | **$1,750** |

### Payment Methods

- Credit/debit card
- Electronic check
- Some states allow alternative methods

## Step 5: Complete Fingerprinting

### FBI Background Check

IMLC requires FBI fingerprint-based background check:

1. **Receive instructions**: After application submission
2. **Schedule appointment**: At approved fingerprinting site
3. **Bring identification**: Government-issued photo ID
4. **Complete fingerprinting**: Electronic submission
5. **Results processed**: 2-4 weeks typically

### Fingerprinting Locations

| Provider | Availability |
|----------|-------------|
| IdentoGO | Nationwide locations |
| Local law enforcement | Some areas |
| Mobile services | Select areas |

## Step 6: SPL State Verification

### What Happens

Your SPL state verifies:
- License is active and unrestricted
- No pending actions
- Meets all SPL requirements
- Credentials confirmed

### Timeline

| Stage | Typical Time |
|-------|-------------|
| SPL review | 5-15 business days |
| Verification submitted | To IMLC Commission |

### Potential Issues

| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| Pending complaints | May delay or disqualify |
| Expired credentials | Must update before proceeding |
| Discrepancies | Require resolution |

## Step 7: IMLC Commission Review

### Central Review Process

The IMLC Commission:
1. Reviews all documentation
2. Confirms eligibility
3. Coordinates with target states
4. Issues Letters of Qualification

### Letter of Qualification (LOQ)

| What It Is | A certification of IMLC eligibility |
|------------|-------------------------------------|
| Who issues | IMLC Commission |
| What it enables | Target states to issue licenses |
| Validity | Limited time to complete process |

## Step 8: Target State Processing

### Each State Receives Your Application

Target states then:
1. Receive LOQ from IMLC
2. Process state-specific requirements
3. Issue license in their state

### State-Specific Requirements

Some states may require additional:

| Requirement | Examples |
|-------------|----------|
| Jurisprudence exam | Some states require |
| Additional documentation | Varies |
| State-specific forms | Varies |

### Timeline

| Stage | Typical Time |
|-------|-------------|
| State processing | 7-30 days |
| License issuance | After state approval |

## Step 9: License Issuance

### Receiving Your New Licenses

| Delivery | Method |
|----------|--------|
| License status | Updated in state database |
| License document | Mailed or downloadable |
| Verification | Available immediately |

### What You Receive

- License number for each state
- Expiration date (follows state's cycle)
- Full practice authority in that state

## Total Timeline

### Typical IMLC Application Timeline

| Stage | Time |
|-------|------|
| Application submission | Day 1 |
| Fingerprinting | 1-2 weeks |
| SPL verification | 1-3 weeks |
| IMLC Commission review | 1-2 weeks |
| Target state processing | 1-4 weeks |
| **Total typical** | **4-10 weeks** |

### Comparison: IMLC vs. Traditional

| Method | Typical Time |
|--------|-------------|
| IMLC (multiple states) | 4-10 weeks total |
| Traditional (per state) | 8-16 weeks each |

## Common Application Problems

### Problem: Ineligibility Discovered

**Cause**: Undiscovered discipline, expired board certification

**Solution**: Address underlying issue, may need traditional application

### Problem: Fingerprint Rejection

**Cause**: Poor quality prints

**Solution**: Re-do fingerprinting at different location

### Problem: SPL State Delay

**Cause**: Board backlog, additional review needed

**Solution**: Contact SPL board directly, follow up

### Problem: Target State Additional Requirements

**Cause**: State-specific jurisprudence or documentation

**Solution**: Complete promptly to avoid holding up entire application

## After License Issuance

### Maintaining IMLC Licenses

IMLC licenses are full state licenses:
- Renew through each state (not through IMLC)
- Follow each state's CME requirements
- Pay each state's renewal fees
- Comply with each state's rules

### Reporting Requirements

You must report to IMLC:
- Any disciplinary action
- License status changes
- Address changes

## Key Takeaways

- **Verify eligibility first**—IMLC has strict requirements
- **$700 IMLC fee** plus individual state fees
- **FBI fingerprinting required**—schedule early
- **Typical timeline**: 4-10 weeks for all licenses
- **Faster than traditional**—process multiple states simultaneously
- **Full state licenses issued**—renew through each state thereafter
- **Michigan withdrawing March 28, 2026**—act before deadline if needed

## Conclusion

The IMLC application process offers significant time savings for physicians seeking multiple state licenses. While the $700 application fee is substantial, the ability to process multiple states simultaneously—often in half the time of traditional applications—provides value for multi-state practitioners.

Use CredentialMate to track your IMLC application progress, monitor target state processing, and manage all your licenses once issued.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How much does IMLC application cost?

The IMLC Commission charges approximately $700 for the application, plus each target state's individual license fee. A 3-state application might total $1,500-2,000 depending on state fees.

### How long does IMLC take compared to traditional licensing?

IMLC typically takes 4-10 weeks to receive all target state licenses. Traditional state-by-state applications often take 8-16 weeks per state. IMLC processes all states simultaneously.

### Can I add more states after my initial IMLC application?

Yes. You can submit subsequent applications for additional states through IMLC. You'll pay the IMLC fee again plus the new state's fee.

### What if I'm denied IMLC eligibility?

If you don't meet IMLC criteria (such as having disciplinary history), you must apply through traditional state-by-state processes. Each state evaluates applications individually and may approve despite issues that disqualify you from IMLC.

### Do I renew IMLC licenses through IMLC?

No. Once issued, IMLC licenses are regular state licenses. You renew through each state's licensing board, pay their renewal fees, and complete their CME requirements. IMLC is only for initial licensure.
