# Colorado Medical License Renewal: Fees and Requirements 2026

## Introduction

Colorado physicians maintain their medical licenses through the Colorado Medical Board, which operates under the Division of Professions and Occupations (DPO) within the Department of Regulatory Agencies (DORA). With a biennial renewal cycle and relatively low formal CME requirements, Colorado offers a straightforward licensing environment—though physicians should be aware that they must maintain competency in their specialty area.

This guide covers everything Colorado physicians need to know about medical license renewal in 2026, including current fees, CME requirements, and the renewal process.

### Fee Context

Colorado's biennial fee represents:
- **Annual equivalent**: ~$150-175/year
- **Comparison**: Lower than average nationally
- **Payment**: Online through DORA portal

## CME Requirements

### Colorado's Unique Approach

Colorado has a **competency-based** approach rather than strict hour requirements:

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| Formal CME Hours | None specifically mandated |
| Competency | Must demonstrate current competency |
| Self-certification | Attestation at renewal |
| Board certification | May satisfy competency |

### Understanding "No CME Requirement"

**Important**: While Colorado doesn't mandate specific CME hours, physicians must:
- Maintain competency in their practice area
- Meet hospital credentialing requirements
- Fulfill specialty board MOC requirements
- Be prepared to demonstrate competency if questioned

### Practical Implications

| Entity | CME Required? |
|--------|---------------|
| Colorado Medical Board | No specific hours |
| Hospitals | Yes (typically 25-50 hours) |
| Insurance panels | Often required |
| Specialty boards | MOC requirements |
| DEA (controlled substances) | Prescriber education |

### Comparison with Other States

| State | Hours | Cycle | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| **Colorado** | **None** | **2 years** | **Competency-based** |
| New York | 0 | 3 years | No CME required |
| California | 50 | 2 years | Mandatory |
| Texas | 24 | 2 years | Mandatory |
| Pennsylvania | 100 | 2 years | Mandatory |

## Renewal Timeline

### Biennial Cycle

Colorado uses a biennial (2-year) renewal cycle:

|-------|--------|
| Renewal cycle | Every 2 years |
| Expiration | Last day of birth month |
| Renewal window | Opens ~90 days before |
| Renewal notice | Sent ~60 days before |
| Grace period | Check current rules |

## Consequences of Non-Renewal

| Expired (grace period) | Late fees apply |

- Subject to civil penalties
- Results in board disciplinary action
- May affect future licensing

### Reinstatement

For lapsed licenses:
1. Apply to Colorado Medical Board
2. Pay reinstatement and back fees
3. Demonstrate current competency
4. Complete any required evaluations
5. Await board approval

## Colorado-Specific Considerations

### Controlled Substances

Colorado physicians prescribing controlled substances must:
- Register with Colorado PDMP
- Check PDMP before prescribing
- Complete prescriber education as required
- Follow all DEA requirements

### Telemedicine

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| License requirement | CO license required for CO patients |
| Out-of-state providers | Must be licensed in CO |
| Standards | Same standard of care as in-person |
| Prescribing | Subject to all CO prescribing rules |

### IMLC Participation

| IMLC Status | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| Participating | Yes |
| SPL eligible | Yes |
| Benefits | Expedited multi-state licensing |

Colorado physicians can:
- Use Colorado as state of principal license
- Obtain licenses in other IMLC states expeditiously
- Apply through the compact process

## Colorado Medical Board Authority

### Disciplinary Actions

The Colorado Medical Board may impose:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Letter of admonition | Non-disciplinary guidance |
| Confidential letter | Private warning |
| Public censure | Formal reprimand |
| Probation | Supervised practice |
| Suspension | Temporary license loss |
| Revocation | Permanent license loss |
| Fines | Civil penalties |
| Practice limitations | Scope restrictions |

### Common Violations

| Violation | Examples |
|-----------|----------|
| Competency issues | Failure to maintain current knowledge |
| Prescribing violations | Controlled substance issues |
| Standard of care | Medical negligence |
| Unprofessional conduct | Ethics violations |
| Impairment | Substance abuse |
| Fraud | False statements |
| Boundary violations | Patient relationship issues |

## CME Planning (Even Without Mandate)

### Why Complete CME Anyway?

Even without state requirements, complete CME for:

1. **Hospital privileges**: Most require 25-50 hours
2. **Insurance panels**: Many require ongoing education
3. **Board certification**: MOC requirements
4. **Malpractice defense**: Demonstrates current knowledge
5. **Professional growth**: Best patient care

### Recommended CME Approach

| Approach | Hours | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| Minimum practical | 25-30/year | Meet hospital requirements |
| Moderate | 40-50/year | Comprehensive competency |
| Specialty-focused | Varies | MOC + specialty advances |

### Free CME Resources

| Resource | Type |
|----------|------|
| Medscape | Online courses |
| CDC | Public health topics |
| Hospital programs | Internal education |
| Colorado Medical Society | Member resources |

## Address and Practice Updates

### Required Notifications

Colorado physicians must notify the board of:
- Address changes (within 30 days)
- Practice changes
- Name changes (with documentation)
- Employment changes (certain circumstances)

### How to Update

1. Log into DORA portal
2. Navigate to profile management
3. Submit changes
4. Provide documentation if needed

## Key Takeaways

- **Biennial renewal with ~$300-350 fee** (~$150-175/year)
- **No specific CME hours mandated**—competency-based
- **Birth month expiration** determines renewal timing
- **Online renewal** through DORA portal
- **Colorado participates in IMLC**
- **C.R.S. 12-240** governs medical practice
- **Complete CME anyway** for hospital, insurance, and board requirements

## Conclusion

Colorado's lack of specific CME requirements doesn't mean physicians can skip continuing education. Hospital credentialing, insurance panels, specialty boards, and professional best practices all demand ongoing learning. Colorado's approach trusts physicians to maintain competency but provides serious consequences for those who don't.

Use CredentialMate to track your Colorado license expiration, monitor CME completion for credentialing purposes, and receive timely renewal reminders.
