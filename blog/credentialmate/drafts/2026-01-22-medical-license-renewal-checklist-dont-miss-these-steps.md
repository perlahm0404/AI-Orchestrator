Whether you're renewing for the first time or need a refresher, this checklist ensures you complete every requirement on time, every time.

- **Know your state's grace period (or lack thereof)**—California, Maryland, and New York have none
- **Track all state licenses separately**—requirements differ by state

## Conclusion

Medical license renewal shouldn't be stressful. By following this checklist, starting 90 days before expiration, and maintaining documentation throughout the year, you can ensure smooth, on-time renewals every cycle.

Use CredentialMate to automate license tracking, monitor CME progress, receive renewal reminders, and maintain organized documentation—taking the stress out of license renewal permanently.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How early should I start my license renewal process?

Start 90 days before your expiration date. This gives you time to complete any missing CME, gather documentation, submit your application with time for processing, and address any issues that arise.

### What if I submit my renewal on time but it's not processed before expiration?

Contact your state board immediately. Most states allow practice to continue if you submitted a complete renewal application before expiration, but policies vary. Get written confirmation of your status and keep documentation of your timely submission.

### Do I need to submit CME certificates with my renewal application?

Most states use self-certification—you certify completion without submitting certificates. However, you must retain documentation for 4-6 years in case of audit. Some states may require documentation upload.

### What happens if I miss a mandatory CME topic?

Your renewal will be denied or delayed until you complete the required topic. Even if you have excess total hours, missing mandatory topics (ethics, opioids, HIV, etc.) will prevent renewal.

### Can I renew my license online?

Yes, most states offer online renewal through their licensing portals. Some states require online renewal; others offer paper alternatives. Check your specific state board's website for options.
