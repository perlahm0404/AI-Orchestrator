## Special Considerations

### Training Certificates

Residents and fellows in Ohio hold Training Certificates rather than full licenses:

| Certificate Type | Holder |
|------------------|--------|
| Training Certificate | Residents, fellows |
| Full License | Attending physicians |

### Telemedicine

Ohio physicians providing telemedicine must:
- Hold active Ohio license for Ohio patients
- Comply with all SMBO regulations
- Meet prescribing requirements

### IMLC Participation

Ohio participates in the Interstate Medical Licensure Compact (IMLC):

| Benefits | Expedited multi-state licensing |

## CME Planning for Ohio

### Strategies for 100 Hours

Given Ohio's high requirement, consider:

1. **Spread throughout cycle**: ~50 hours per year
2. **Use conferences**: Multi-day events offer 20-40 credits
3. **Online learning**: Flexible, often free options
4. **Specialty board MOC**: Counts toward both requirements
5. **Hospital programs**: Grand rounds, internal education

### Free CME Resources

| Resource | Type |
|----------|------|
| Medscape | Online courses |
| CDC | Public health topics |
| Hospital programs | Internal CME |
| Medical societies | Member benefits |

### Tracking CME

With 100 hours required, tracking is essential:
- Maintain organized certificate files
- Use tracking software (CredentialMate)
- Log activities as completed
- Review progress quarterly

## Key Takeaways

- **Biennial renewal fee is $305**

## Conclusion

Ohio's 100-hour CME requirement demands proactive planning and ongoing education throughout the renewal cycle. At $305 biennially, the fee is moderate, but the CME investment—both time and cost—makes Ohio one of the more demanding states for physician license maintenance.
