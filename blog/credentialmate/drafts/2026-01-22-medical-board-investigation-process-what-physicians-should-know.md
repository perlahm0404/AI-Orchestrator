## Frequently Asked Questions

### Should I respond to a board complaint without an attorney?

It's generally not advisable. Even seemingly minor complaints can escalate. An attorney experienced in medical board matters can help you respond appropriately and avoid common pitfalls that worsen outcomes.

### How long does a medical board investigation take?

Most investigations take 6-18 months from complaint to resolution. Complex cases or those proceeding to formal hearing can take 2-3 years or longer. Dismissals and informal resolutions are faster.

### Will a complaint appear on my public record?

Only final disciplinary actions become public record. Complaints that are dismissed, closed without action, or resolved informally typically remain confidential. Consent agreements and formal discipline are public.

### Can I continue practicing during an investigation?

Usually yes, unless the board issues an emergency suspension for immediate patient safety concerns. However, you may need to disclose the pending investigation to certain parties (hospitals, insurers).

### What happens if I ignore a board investigation?

Ignoring board communications can result in default findings against you, automatic discipline, or license suspension. Always respond within deadlines, even if only to request extensions.
