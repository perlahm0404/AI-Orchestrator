# Michigan IMLC Withdrawal 2026: What Physicians Need to Know

## Introduction

**Michigan is withdrawing from the Interstate Medical Licensure Compact (IMLC) effective March 28, 2026.** This significant change affects thousands of physicians who hold Michigan licenses obtained through the IMLC or who planned to use the compact to practice in Michigan.

Under 2023 Public Act 124, Michigan's participation in the IMLC ends in March 2026, requiring physicians to apply directly to the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs (LARA) for new licenses after this date. This guide explains the withdrawal timeline, impact on current license holders, and steps physicians should take to maintain or obtain Michigan licensure.

## Key Dates and Timeline

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| 2023 | Michigan Legislature passes 2023 Public Act 124 |
| March 28, 2025 | 12-month withdrawal countdown begins |
| Through March 27, 2026 | Michigan continues processing IMLC applications |
| **March 28, 2026** | **Withdrawal effective—IMLC no longer available for Michigan** |
| After March 28, 2026 | Direct application to LARA required |

## What This Means for Physicians

### If You Already Have a Michigan IMLC License

**Good news**: Your existing Michigan license remains valid.

| Aspect | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| License validity | Remains valid per normal renewal schedule |
| Renewal process | Renew directly with Michigan LARA |
| License number | Unchanged |
| CME requirements | Follow Michigan requirements |

Your license was issued by Michigan—the IMLC was simply the application pathway. The license itself is a Michigan state license and remains valid regardless of IMLC status.

### If You're Planning to Apply Through IMLC

**Apply before March 28, 2026** to use the expedited IMLC process:

| Application Timing | Process |
|-------------------|---------|
| Before March 28, 2026 | IMLC expedited pathway available |
| After March 28, 2026 | Direct Michigan application required |

### If You Need a Michigan License After March 2026

You'll need to apply directly to Michigan LARA:

- Traditional state application process
- Longer processing time (typically 4-8 weeks vs. 2-4 weeks IMLC)
- Michigan-specific documentation requirements
- Direct fee payment to Michigan

## Why Michigan Is Withdrawing

### Legislative Background

Michigan's participation in the IMLC was authorized under MCL 333.16189. The legislation included a sunset provision:

> The IMLC authorization is repealed effective March 28, 2025, beginning a 12-month withdrawal process.

The withdrawal was not due to problems with the compact but rather legislative decisions about interstate agreements and state regulatory autonomy.

### Withdrawal Mechanics

Under IMLC rules:
- Member states may withdraw with 12 months notice
- Withdrawal doesn't affect licenses already issued
- The state continues participating during the notice period
- After withdrawal, the state is no longer a compact member

## Impact on Multi-State Practitioners

### Telemedicine Providers

If you provide telemedicine to Michigan patients:

| Current Status | After March 2026 |
|---------------|------------------|
| IMLC license for Michigan | License remains valid, renew with LARA |
| Planning to add Michigan | Apply through IMLC before March 28, 2026 |
| No Michigan license planned | Apply directly to LARA after March 2026 |

### Locum Tenens Physicians

For temporary assignments in Michigan:

- **Before March 2026**: Use IMLC for expedited licensing
- **After March 2026**: Direct LARA application required
- **Planning tip**: Obtain Michigan license now while IMLC available

### Border State Physicians

Physicians in Ohio, Indiana, Wisconsin, and nearby states who see Michigan patients:

- Consider obtaining Michigan license before March 2026
- IMLC pathway significantly faster than direct application
- License obtained now valid for years

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Will my existing Michigan IMLC license be revoked?

No. Licenses issued through IMLC are Michigan state licenses. The withdrawal affects only the application pathway—existing licenses remain valid and are renewed directly with Michigan LARA.

### Can I still renew my Michigan license after the withdrawal?

Yes. You'll renew directly with Michigan LARA according to Michigan's normal renewal schedule. The IMLC withdrawal doesn't change the renewal process for existing licenses.

### What if my IMLC application is pending on March 28, 2026?

Contact both the IMLC and Michigan LARA. Applications submitted before the deadline should be processed, but confirm your specific situation with both entities.

### Is Michigan rejoining the IMLC in the future?

There's no current legislation to rejoin. Michigan would need to pass new legislation to re-enter the compact. Monitor Michigan legislative updates for any changes.

### How does this affect my other IMLC licenses?

It doesn't. Your IMLC licenses in other states are unaffected by Michigan's withdrawal. The IMLC continues operating in 41 other states plus DC and Guam.
